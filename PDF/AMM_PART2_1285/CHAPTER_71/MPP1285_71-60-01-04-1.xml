			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE ENGINE COMPONENTS UNTIL THEY ARE COOL. THE TEMPERATURE STAYS HOT AFTER THE ENGINE STOPS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE ENGINE CONTROL MASTER SWITCH IS IN THE “OFF” POSITION TO PREVENT AN ENGINE ACCIDENTAL OPERATION. (1) Open these circuit breakers and attach DO-NOT-CLOSE tags to them: – START 1/2. – ENGINE AIR INLET 1/2. (2) Put the workstand in the work area. (3) Remove the related components: (a) Lower Cowling (AMM TASK 71-12-01-000-802-A/400). (b) Upper Cowling (AMM TASK 71-11-01-000-801-A/400). (c) Nacelle Apron (AMM TASK 71-13-01-000-801-A/400). J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: HEATED ANTI-ICE COMPONENTS CAN BURN YOU. MAKE SURE THAT THE ANTI-ICE COMPONENTS ARE COOL. CAUTION: PUT CAPS ON THE DUCTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU DISCONNECT THEM TO PREVENT ENTRY OF CONTAMINATION. (1) Install the LH/RH Nose Cowl Door Sling to the air intake. CAUTION: ADJUST THE LH/RH NOSE COWL DOOR SLING TO HOLD ONLY THE WEIGHT OF THE AIR INTAKE. MORE WEIGHT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIR INTAKE AND SLING. (2) Put the hoist adjacent to the air intake, and attach it to the LH/RH Nose Cowl Door Sling. Adjust the height of the hoist correctly. (3) Cut and remove the lockwire from the clamp (5). (4) Loosen the clamps (5) and remove the generators cooling flexible ducts (6). (5) Remove the wire bundle brackets (4). (6) Loosen the clamp (3), and disconnect the anti-ice duct (2). (7) Remove the mounting bolts (1). (8) Pull the air intake forward to make it clear of the location pins. Put the air intake on the platform and away from the aircraft. (9) Remove the hoist and the LH/RH Nose Cowl Door Sling from the air intake. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 71-60-01 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
