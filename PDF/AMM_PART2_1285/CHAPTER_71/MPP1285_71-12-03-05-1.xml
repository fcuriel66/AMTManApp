			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 71-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • START 1/2. (2) Put the workstand in position and get access to the engine nacelle. (3) Open the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-000-801-A/400). J. Adjustment/Test (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 820-002-A WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE ENGINE COMPONENTS UNTIL THEY ARE COOL. TEMPERATURE CAN STAY HOT AFTER THE ENGINE STOPS. (1) Adjust all the apron keeper eyebolts to the extended position in all tie rod brackets of the new latches installed. (2) Make sure that the door latches are free of debris. (3) Engage all latches. Make sure that the door locators are correctly engaged. (4) Release the latch handles and adjust the apron keeper eyebolts until the latches can be engaged again with a contact between the apron structure and all spigots. (5) The gap between the door edge and the apron must be 2 mm (0.078 in) to 6 mm (0.236 in) with all spigots in contact with the apron structure. (6) A new adjustment to the keeper eyebolt can be necessary to have the necessary preload of 156 N (35 lbf) to 178 N (40 lbf) at the end of the handle to engage the latches, as shown in figure 501. (7) If an adjustment is necessary to have the gap between the lower cowling door and the apron specified before or because of nacelle conditions, the washers supplied can be removed or added at each spigot location. NOTE: • A maximum of two washers are permitted at each spigot. • Adjustments to get conditions of preload and gap for load and position must be done at the same time for a good installation. (8) After the adjustment made with the removal or installation of washers, open the lower cowling door and torque each spigot retaining nut as shown in figure 501, 23.7 N.m (210 lb.in). (9) Make sure that all latches are with the closing force kept with all spigots in contact with apron structure, and with the necessary door gap.
