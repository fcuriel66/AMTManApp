General (1) This procedure gives the necessary instructions to operate the engine when you must make sure that the operation of the engine or related systems is correct. (2) In cold weather, more preparations such as preheating can be necessary. The procedure to operate the engine in cold weather is given in ( AMM TASK 71-00-01-910-802-A/200). (3) The engine compartment clean condition is important. The strong airflow causes unwanted material to come into the engine. Always fully clean and examine the area at the beginning and at the end of the task to keep the inlet area clean. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: • EMBRAER AND HAMILTON SUNDSTRAND DO NOT RECOMMEND APU OPERATION DURING THE AIRCRAFT DEICING/ANTI-ICING PROCEDURE. IF THE APU IS KEPT IN OPERATION DURING THE DEICING/ANTI-ICING PROCEDURE, DAMAGE CAN OCCUR TO IT. IF THE APU OPERATION IS VERY NECESSARY, MAKE SURE THAT THE APU BLEED VALVE IS CLOSED, PACKS ARE SET TO OFF, AND THE DEICING/ANTI-ICING FLUID WILL NOT BE APPLIED DIRECTLY TO OR NEAR THE APU AIR INLET. • REMOVE ALL DEICING/ANTI-ICING FLUID BUILD-UP BEFORE THE ENGINE OR THE APU STARTS. IF NOT, DAMAGE TO COMPONENTS CAN OCCUR. (10) To start the engine with the APU as a pneumatic power source, start the APU ( AMM TASK 49-10-00-910-802-A/200 or AMM TASK 49-13-00-910-802-A/200 as applicable) and make sure that the APU BLEED pushbutton is positioned to the OPEN position (Figure 201). (11) Do a check of the engine thrust lever for free movement, no play, and full travel. (12) Adjust the seat and pedals as necessary. (13) Make sure that all switches/controls of the systems not used for the engine start are OFF/CLOSED. (14) Set/keep these switches and controls as follows (Figure 201): • Engine thrust lever to IDLE. • Bus Ties to AUTO. • Shed Buses to AUTO. • AC Power to ON. • Backup Battery to ON. • Avionics Masters to ON. • Ignition to AUTO. • Start/Stop selector to STOP. • Electrical Hydraulic Pumps to OFF. • Crossbleed to OPEN or AUTO. • Bleed Air to CLOSED. • Air Conditioning Packs to OPEN if the APU is on and the APU Bleed is OPEN. • Clocks set. (15) NOTE: This step start the recording function of the FDR which will overwrite the data stored in the FDR.

(16) If it is necessary to keep the data stored in the FDR, open the FDR circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel or if it is necessary to keep the FDR on, do an FDR downloading according to AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500. (17) Do a check on the Fire Detection System (AMM TASK 26-10-00-700-801-A/500) or (AMM TASK 26-10-00-700-802-A/500) as applicable. (18) Make sure that the Engine Hydraulic Pump Shutoff buttons are guarded OFF (Figure 201). (19) Close the windows. (20) Set the TAKE OFF data as follows (Figure 201): • Set MFD1 (or 2) to the TO page (AMM SDS 76-12-00/1). • Push the STORE pushbutton, on the powerplant panel (overhead panel). A bug comes into view on the right side of the REF TO TEMP inscription on the TO page. • Set the ambient temperature, with the DEC/INC switch. Refer to the ATC Ground Control/Tower as a source of static air temperature (SAT). • Push the STORE pushbutton to record the TO data and change the bug to the REF A ICE inscription. • Set the anti-icing condition as necessary, with the DEC/INC switch. Turn to DEC to set the anti-icing OFF condition and turn to INC to set the anti-icing ON condition. • Push the STORE pushbutton to record the A ICE data. The bug goes out of view on the right side of the REF A ICE inscription on the TO page. • The TO and A ICE data are shown amber after their setting until the engine starts. When the engine starts, the TO and A ICE data change from amber to cyan. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 910-801-A/200 71-00-01 Page 5 of 31 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Engine Start Procedure (Normal) (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 910-002-A CAUTION: DURING THE START PROCEDURES, OBEY THE PRECAUTIONS BELOW: • IF A START IS ABORTED FOR SOME CAUSE (HUNG START, COMPRESSOR SURGE, COMPRESSOR STALL AT LOW N2 SPEEDS), LET THE ENGINE STOP BEFORE YOU DO THE STARTING PROCEDURE AGAIN. • IF THERE IS NO POSITIVE INDICATION OF OIL PRESSURE DURING THE STARTING CYCLE, ABORT THE START. FIND THE CAUSE OF THE INCORRECT INDICATION. • IF THE ITT INCREASES QUICKLY TO AS HIGH AS 800ÃÂ°C (1472ÃÂ°F), ABORT THE START. • AFTER AN ABORTED START, DO A DRY MOTORING ( AMM TASK 71-00-01-910-803-A/200), BEFORE YOU START THE ENGINE AGAIN. (1) Set the crossfeed switch as applicable(Figure 201). CAUTION: DAMAGE TO THE FUEL PUMP WILL OCCUR IF IT OPERATES WITH NO FUEL (DRY OPERATION). THUS, SEE THE FUEL LEVEL IN THE FUEL TANKS BEFORE YOU TURN ON THE FUEL PUMP. (2) NOTE: At each engine start, change from one electrical pump to the other. Set one electrical fuel pump to ON (Figure 201). (3) Release the protective guard and set the start switch as follows (Figure 201): (a) Set the start switch to RUN and momentarily set it to START (Figure 201). (4) Monitor the engine parameters (ITT, OIL PRESSURE, N1, N2, and FF), on the EICAS display (Figure 201). NOTE: • Do not alternate/reset FADECs while the power levers are operated. • The IGN A (B) indication goes out view on the EICAS display. This shows that the start cycle is completed. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Set the Electrical Panel as applicable. (2) Operate the APU as applicable. (3) Set the Electric Hydraulic Pumps to AUTO (Figure 201). (4) Set the Ice Protection as necessary. CAUTION: BEFORE YOU REMOVE THE EXTERNAL DC POWER SUPPLY, MAKE SURE THAT THE GPU PUSHBUTTON IS SET TO THE OFF (RELEASED) POSITION (FIGURE 201).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: • With the air temperature at 10ÃÂ°C (50ÃÂ°F) or below, or at the first sign of ice on any surface, do as follows. • If the anti-icing system is ON, with no ice on the fan blades, the thrust will increase at colder ambient temperatures, but will stay approximately the same at warmer ambient temperature, due to the added effect of bleed air usage. (1) Set the crossfeed switch as applicable (Figure 201). CAUTION: DAMAGE TO THE FUEL PUMP WILL OCCUR IF IT OPERATES WITH NO FUEL (DRY OPERATION). THUS, CHECK THE FUEL LEVEL IN THE FUEL TANKS BEFORE YOU TURN ON THE FUEL PUMP. (2) NOTE: At each engine start, change from one electrical pump to the other. Set one electrical fuel pump to ON (Figure 201). (3) Set the ignition switch to ON (Figure 201). NOTE: For the first start of the day or if it is 90 minutes since the engine was last started, it is recommended that the engine be started with the ignition switch at the ON position. After a successful start, move the ignition switch back to the AUTO position. (4) Set the engine air inlet to OPEN (Figure 201). (5) Release the protective guard and set the start switch as follows (Figure 201): (a) Set the start switch to RUN and momentarily set it to START (Figure 201). CAUTION: ICE INGESTION AND POSSIBLE ENGINE DAMAGE OR FLAME OUT CAN OCCUR IF YOU USE THE ENGINE ANTI-ICING SYSTEM ONLY AFTER THE ICE BUILD-UP IS VISIBLE FROM THE COCKPIT. (6) Set the ICE DETECTION OVERRIDE master switch to the ENG position except during ice protection system test (Figure 201). (7) NOTE: • Monitor the vibration for signs of ice. Ice on the fan blades can increase the vibration at fan speeds less than 50% N1. • For fan speeds of more than 50% N1, the vibration caused by icing is not frequent. If the vibration occurs at more than 50% N1 speed, there can be other causes for the vibration. If the vibration increases while in the icing conditions and at low speeds, increase the fan speed to 60% N1, minimum, for 3 to 5 seconds, then decrease it back to the necessary thrust. (8) NOTE: If the vibration continues the same or increases, refer to AMM MPP 71-00-00/200. To make sure that the vibration is caused by the ice, increase the fan speed to 75% N1 minimum and then decrease it back to the necessary thrust. (9) NOTE: • Do not alternate/reset FADECs while the power levers are operated. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 910-802-A/200 71-00-01 Page 12 of 31 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 71-00-01-910-803-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 4. ENGINE DRY MOTORING PROCEDURE (START CYCLE WITHOUT FUEL/IGNITION) A. General (1) This procedure gives the necessary instructions to do an engine dry motoring. This procedure is used when you purge the engine to remove fuel and/or fuel vapor caught in the engine interior after an unsatisfactory start. (2) The engine compartment clean condition is important. The strong airflow causes unwanted material to come into the engine. Always fully clean and examine the area at the end of the task to keep the inlet area clean. B.
