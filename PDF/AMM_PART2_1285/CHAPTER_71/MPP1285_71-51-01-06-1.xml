			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Engine I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 71-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them. • AIR COND EBV 1/2. • ENG AIR INLET 1/2. • FUEL PUMP 1B/2A. • FUEL PUMP 1A/2B. • AIR COND HSV 1/2. • POWERPLANT FIRE DET 1/2. • START 1/2. (2) Put the workstand in the work area. (3) Remove the upper cowling (AMM TASK 71-11-01-000-801-A/400) to get access to the engine. J. Engine Harness - Visual Inspection (Figure 601)  (Figure 602)  (Figure 603)  SUBTASK 212-002-A CAUTION: • MAKE SURE THAT THE ENGINE HARNESSES ARE CORRECTLY ATTACHED AND THERE IS NO CHAFING AGAINST THE ENGINE COMPONENTS, COWLINGS AND PYLON STRUCTURE. THIS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS TO THE CORRECT ENGINE OPERATION. REFER TO FIGURE 601, 602 AND 603 FOR CORRECT ROUTING OF THE ENGINE HARNESSES. • TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENGINE HARNESSES ARE CORRECTLY INSTALLED, OBEY THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN IN THE HARNESS GENERAL REQUIREMENTS SECTION, ON WM 20-21-00. • IF CLAMP (1) IS NOT INSTALLED, THE HARNESS THAT IT HOLDS CAN CHAFE AGAINST THE COWLING. AS A RESULT OF TOO MUCH CHAFING, WIRES CAN BECOME BARE AND A SHORT-CIRCUIT WILL OCCUR. (1) Do a general visual inspection of the FADEC control harnesses (LH and RH engines) as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 71-51-01 Page 3 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Examine for kinks at the attachment of the connector to the wiring. • Examine for correct routing and attachment. • Examine for integrity of the insulation. • Examine all clamps for general condition. • Make sure that the harnesses do not chafe against the oil tubes. • Make sure that the harnesses do not chafe against components and flanges. • Make sure that the clamp (1) is correctly installed and the harness does not chafe against the cowling structure. • Make sure that the cushion of all clamps is in good condition and the metallic part of the clamps does not chafe against the harness. • Make sure that the oil tank mounting lever assembly (2) does not chafe against the harness. • Make sure that that the tube support (3) does not chafe against the harness. • Make sure that the hydraulic hose set (4) does not chafe against the harness. • Make sure that the parts shown in DET. B of Figure 603 do not chafe against the harnesses. • Make sure that the exciter boxes and its adjacent components do not chafe against the harness (Ref. AMM SDS 77-20-00/1). • Make sure that the ITT trim plug does not chafe against the harness (Ref. AMM SDS 74-10-00/1). (2) If repair is necessary, refer to Unison CMM 71-50-04. (3) If replacement is necessary, refer to AMM MPP 71-51-01/400. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the upper cowling (AMM TASK 71-11-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Remove the workstand from the work area. (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them. • AIR COND EBV 1/2. • ENG AIR INLET 1/2. • FUEL PUMP 1B/2A. • FUEL PUMP 1A/2B. • AIR COND HSV 1/2. • POWERPLANT FIRE DET 1/2.
