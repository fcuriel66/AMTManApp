			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Do not operate the systems that use hydraulic power. (a) Write the amperage value read on the ammeter of the external electrical power source. (b) Turn on the EMDP of hydraulic system 1 or system 2. (c) After the pressure becomes stable at 2900 ÃÂ± 200 psi, write the amperage value read on the ammeter of the external electrical-power source. (d) If the difference between the amperage value of steps (c) and (a) is less than 80 amperes, no procedure is necessary. (e) If the difference between the amperage value of steps (c) and (a) is more than 80 amperes, turn off the EMDP, disconnect the EMDP pressure hose from the manifold, and seal it with a plug. (f) Turn on the EMDP of hydraulic system 1 or system 2. (g) After the pressure becomes stable at 2900 ÃÂ± 200 psi, write the amperage value read on the ammeter of the external electrical-power source. (h) If the difference between the amperage value of steps (g) and (a) is more than 65 amperes, replace the EMDP ( AMM TASK 29-10-04-000-801-A/400) and ( AMM TASK 29-10-04-400-801-A/400). (i) If the difference between the amperage value of steps (g) and (a) is less than 65 amperes, connect the hose and look for internal leakage in the hydraulic system. (j) With the EMDP "on", examine the locations where hydraulic components are installed. • Listen for noise typical of internal leakage. • Touch the pressure and return hydraulic lines and components to find unusually high temperature at the internal leakage path. (k) Examine these locations: • Nose hydraulic compartment (System 1 only). • Nose landing-gear compartment. • Main landing-gear compartment. • Hydraulic racks. • Hydraulic compartment at wing stub. • Aileron PCA compartment. • Thrust-reverser isolation valve (rear fuselage). • Rudder PCU's. (l) Turn off the EMDP of hydraulic system 1 and/or system 2. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 29-10-00-700-804-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 3. ELECTRIC MOTOR-DRIVEN PUMP INPUT SIGNALS - OPERATIONAL CHECK A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do a check of the inputs to automatically drive the Electric Motor-Driven Pump (EMDP). The inputs to automatically drive the pump are: • Signal from N2 FADEC A. • Signal from N2 FADEC B. • Signal of the pressure (ENG PUMP PRESSURE SWITCH). (2) This procedure is applicable to the EMDP of hydraulic systems 1 and 2. B.

Operationally Check Electric Motor-Driven Pump Input Signals SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING:THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE APPLICABLE GOGGLES AND RUBBER GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) Do the check of the signal from N2 FADEC 1A SYS 1 as follows: (a) Close the N2 SIGNAL 1A circuit breakers. (b) Make sure that the N2 SIGNAL 1B circuit breakers is open. (c) Disconnect connector P0365 of the ENG PUMP pressure switch. (d) Set the EMDP1 switch in "AUTO" position. Result: 1 The EMDP1 in the AUTO mode is turned on. (e) Open the N2 SIGNAL 1A circuit breakers. Result: 1 The EMDP1 is turned off. (f) Set the EMDP1 switch in "OFF" position. (2) Do the check of the signal from N2 FADEC 1B SYS 1 as follows: (a) Close the N2 SIGNAL 1B circuit breakers. (b) Make sure that the N2 SIGNAL 1A circuit breakers is open.
