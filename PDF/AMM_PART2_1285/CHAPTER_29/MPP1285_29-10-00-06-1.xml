			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL MAIN HYDRAULIC SYSTEM - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do the analysis of the hydraulic fluid. B. The function of the analysis is to know the condition of the hydraulic fluid and the correct time for its change. C. Obey these instructions to do the analysis of the hydraulic fluid: • Collect samples from the sampling valves (pressure and return) of each hydraulic system. 3 • Use four 100-ml (6-in ) flasks sealed with caps. Use two flasks for each system. • Make sure that the flasks are fully clean and washed with solvent (Fed. Spec. P-D-680, type 1, or equivalent). D. To get good results, it is very important to collect the samples in a clean environment. E. Too much contamination of the hydraulic fluid can cause unsatisfactory performance of the system. Contamination can cause wear of the components before the usual time. F. You can get access to system 1 through access panel 193BL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). G. You can get access to system 2 through access panel 193CR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). H. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

(x) - The fluid manufacturer inform a maximum value of 1.5 mg KOH/gm but Embraer recommends a maximum limit of 1.0 mg KOH/gm because it will avoid additional flushing to achieve the neutralization level. (2) Collection of Hydraulic Fluid. (a) Get access to the hydraulic reservoir of system 1 through access panel 193BL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). For the hydraulic reservoir of system 2, the access is through access panel 193CR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (b) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). CAUTION: THE EMDP MUST BE KEPT ON ONLY DURING THE NECESSARY TIME TO COLLECT THE HYDRAULIC FLUID. (c) Pressurize hydraulic systems 1 and 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (d) Operate the aileron and rudder to make the hydraulic fluid flow through the system to get a homogeneous sample of the hydraulic fluid. (e) To collect the hydraulic fluid, do as follows: WARNING: THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE GOGGLES AND RUBBER GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. 1 NOTE: Get the sample in 1 hour after landing. When it is not possible to get the sample immediately after landing, for you to get homogeneous samples of hydraulic fluid, operate the units that use the hydraulic system at the highest flow possible and thus diffuse EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-803-A/600 29-10-00 Page 4 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL the contaminants. It is recommended that the hydraulic system be operated for a minimum of 15 minutes at a fluid temperature higher than 30 ÃÂ°C (86 ÃÂ°F), before you can have a representative sample. Put an open-top container with approximately 1-liter (58-cubic inch) capacity below the return sampling valve to collect the hydraulic fluid from system 1 (Figure 601). NOTE: This procedure will help you get samples with more precision. 2 Drain approximately 50 ml of hydraulic fluid from system 1 through the return sampling valve and discard the fluid. 3 Do steps (1) and (2) again for the pressure sampling valve. 4 Do steps (1) thru (3) again for hydraulic system 2. CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE 100-ml or 250-ml FLASKS ARE COMPLETELY CLEAN AND WASHED WITH SOLVENT (SOLVENT PER FED. SPEC. P-D-680, TYPE I OR EQUIVALENT). 5 Put the 100-ml or 250-ml flask below the return sampling valve of system 1. NOTE: 1. If the laboratory will use the automatic particle counters (APC) calibrated per the new ISO 11171 method to identify the particle contamination, use a flask of 250 ml. 2. If the laboratory will use the Electron Microscope method to identify the particle contamination, use a flask of 100 ml. 6 Fully fill the 100-ml or 250-ml flask with fluid. Next, close the flask and put a label on it to identify the aircraft, the return sampling valve, and hydraulic system 1. 7 Do steps (5) and (6) again for the pressure sampling valve. 8 Do steps (5) thru (7) again for hydraulic system 2. 9 Send hydraulic fluid samples to a laboratory for analysis by the methods indicated in step (1)-a. (f) Depressurize hydraulic systems 1 and 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (3) Analysis of Hydraulic Fluid during Scheduled Maintenance. NOTE: It is recommended that the hydraulic fluid analysis be made during scheduled maintenance when there is sufficient time to get the laboratory analysis results and do additional actions, if necessary. (a) Compare the laboratory report with the data in Table 601. (b) If the laboratory report shows that the hydraulic fluid is not contaminated, the job is OK.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) If the laboratory report shows that the hydraulic fluid is contaminated because the fluid inspection by the particle-counting method shows more contamination than the permitted quantity, do as follows: 1 Do the Hydraulic Fluid - Decontamination ( AMM TASK 29-00-01-910-801- A/200). 2 Operate the aileron and rudder to make the hydraulic fluid flow through the systems. 3 Obey the instructions given in step (2) (e) and send the samples to a laboratory for analysis. NOTE: It is not necessary to wait for the laboratory report to put the aircraft back into service. 4 Do the procedures specified in step (3) again and again until the laboratory report shows that the hydraulic fluid is not contaminated. (4) Analysis of Hydraulic Fluid during In-Service Operation. NOTE: Do the Analysis of Hydraulic Fluid during In-Service Operation when: • The aircraft is in in-service operation. • There is not sufficient time to wait for the test results. (a) Fully drain the fluid from the reservoir of the related system (system 1 or system 2) through the sampling valves. (b) Fill the hydraulic reservoir with new fluid ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-802-A/300). (c) Operate the aileron and rudder to make the hydraulic fluid flow through the systems. (d) Obey the instructions given in step (2) (e) and send the samples to a laboratory for analysis. (e) Do the procedures specified in step (3) again and again until the laboratory report shows that the hydraulic fluid is not contaminated. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Make sure that the hydraulic reservoir is full. If necessary, fill the reservoirs ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-802-A/300). (2) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Install access panel 193BL and/or 193CR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100).
