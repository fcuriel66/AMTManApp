			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL ELECTRIC MOTOR-DRIVEN PUMP - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to remove/install the EMDP (Electric-Motor-Driven Pump). B. The procedures for removal and installation of the EMDP of system 1 and system 2 are equivalent. C. The only difference between the two hydraulic pumps is their position in relation to the electrical- motor cooling-air scoop. Such a difference is shown in Figure 401. D. You can get access to the EMDP of system 1 through access panel 193BL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). E. You can get access to the EMDP of system 2 through 193CR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). F. If the replacement is because of a mechanical failure, examine the pressure and case drain filter elements for contamination (AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400). G. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).
