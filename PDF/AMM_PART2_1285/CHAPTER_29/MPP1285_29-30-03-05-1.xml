			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 29-30-03-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. HYDRAULIC FILTERS DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE INDICATOR (DPIS)- FUNCTIONAL CHECK A. General (1) This procedure is applicable to the hydraulic filters differential pressure indicators of hydraulic systems 1 and 2. (2) To prevent incorrect indications, do not operate the differential pressure indicators (DPI) at a temperature of less than 15.5ÃÂ°C. At temperatures higher than 32.2ÃÂ°C, they operate correctly.

(g) Slowly decrease the pressure of the hand pump. (h) Set the DPI red pin (11) again. Refer to Figure 501, DET.B. (i) Remove the filter bowl and the dummy filter element. (j) Disconnect the hose (3) of the hand pump from the refill port of the reservoir (7). Refer to Figure 501. (k) Install the return filter element (8). Refer to AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400. NOTE: Before you install the filter bowl, fill it with hydraulic fluid. (2) Do a check of the DPI of the CS DR filter of hydraulic system 1 as follows: (a) Remove the CS DR filter element (9). Refer to AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/ 400. (b) Install the dummy filter element and the filter bowl to make a condition equivalent to a blocked filter. (c) Disconnect the EMDP return hose (1) and install the plug (3) to its end. Refer to Figure 502. (d) Connect the hose of the hand pump to the check valve (7) of the pump return line. Refer to Figure 502. (e) Increase the temperature of the DPI (12) with a heat gun to approximately 40ÃÂ°C. Refer to Figure 501, DET.B. (f) Operate the hand pump and make sure that you get this result: Result:  1 The DPI of the CS DR filter moves out with 70 ÃÂ± 10 psi. (g) Set the heat gun to off. (h) Release the pressure of the hand pump. (i) Set the DPI red pin (12) again. Refer to Figure 501, DET.B. (j) Remove the filter bowl and the dummy filter element. (k) Disconnect the hose of the hand pump from the check valve (7) of the pump return line. Refer to Figure 502. (l) Remove the plug (3) from the EMDP return hose (1).
