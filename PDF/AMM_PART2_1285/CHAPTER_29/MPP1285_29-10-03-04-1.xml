			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL ENGINE-DRIVEN PUMP - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to remove/install the EDP (Engine-Driven Pump). B. The two EDPs operated by the gear box are installed in the LH engine (system 1) and in the RH engine (system 2). C. You can get access to the EDP of the LH engine (system 1) through lower cowling 413 (AMM MPP 06-30-00/100). D. You can get access to the EDP of the RH engine (system 2) through lower cowling 423 (AMM MPP 06-30-00/100). E. If the replacement is because of a mechanical failure, examine the pressure and case drain filter elements for contamination ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400). F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (12) Lubricate O-ring (14) with the engine-gear-box oil and install it to the coupling shaft (13). CAUTION:INSTALL THE EDP (4) WITH ITS IDENTIFICATION PLACARD POINTED OUTBOARD ON THE RH SIDE AND INBOARD TO THE LH SIDE TO PREVENT THE INVERTION OF THE CASE DRAIN AND THE SEEPAGE DRAIN PORTS. (13) Put the new EDP (4), with the new gasket (8), to the gear box flange. (14) Install the washers (6) and nuts (5). Torque the nuts (5) as given in (Figure 401). (15) Connect the pressure hydraulic line (1). Torque as given in (Figure 401). NOTE: Torque the flexible hoses with reusable fittings, use the points shown in AMM TASK 20-10-06-300-801-A/800. (16) Connect the suction hydraulic line (2). NOTE: Torque the flexible hoses with reusable fittings, use the points shown in AMM TASK 20-10-06-300-801-A/800. (17) Fill the EDP (4) at the connection point of the case drain hydraulic line (3) with hydraulic fluid. (18) Connect the case drain hydraulic line (3). Apply the torque as given in (Figure 401). NOTE: Torque the flexible hoses with reusable fittings, use the points shown in AMM TASK 20-10-06-300-801-A/800. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, close the ELEC PUMP 1 and (or) ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker(s) and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it (them). (2) Pressurize the related hydraulic system through the EMDP (Electrical-Motor-Driven Pump). Do the bleed of air from the hydraulic system lines ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-803-A/200). (3) Apply the torque to the connections of suction hydraulic line (2) as given in (Figure 401). (4) Fill the hydraulic reservoir ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-802-A/300). (5) Pressurize the related hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200), with the engine in operation. Make sure that there are no leaks in the EDP and that the pressure shown on the MFD (Multi Function Display) is 2900 ÃÂ± 200 psi. (6) Close the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-400-801-A/400). (7) Do the engine leak test (run at maximum take-off power for a minimum of three minutes but not more than five minutes). Refer to the latest revision of Rolls-Royce MM CSP34022.
