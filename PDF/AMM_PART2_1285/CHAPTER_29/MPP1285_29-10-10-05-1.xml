			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL RETURN FILTER BY-PASS VALVE - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do a check of the return-filter by-pass valve. B. In case you still have performed the check of hydraulic fluid contamination AMM TASK 29-10-00-200-803-A/600 is suggested to perform this task ( AMM TASK 29-10-10-700-801-A/500) in the same opportunity of the task AMM TASK 29-30-03-700-801-A/500 (DPIs check). C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Hydraulic system compartments I. Preparation (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 841-005-A (1) Remove access panels 193BL (SYS 1) and 193CR (SYS 2) (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (2) Connect the pressure gage (2) to the outlet of the hand pump (1). Refer to Figure 501. (3) Connect one end of the hose (3) to the pressure gage (2). (4) Connect a hose (4) with a filter (5) to the inlet of the hand pump (1). Refer to Figure 501. (5) Put the other end of the hose (4) in the reservoir (6) with hydraulic fluid. J. Functional Check of Return Filter By-Pass Valve (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-005-A (1) Do a check of the by-pass valve of the return filter of hydraulic system 1 as follows: (a) Remove the return filter element (8). Refer to AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/ 400. (b) Install the dummy filter element and the filter bowl to make a condition equivalent to a blocked filter. (c) Connect the hose (3) to the refill port of the reservoir (7). Refer to Figure 501. (d) Operate the hand pump and make sure that you get this result: Result: 1 The by-pass valve (14) opens with 110 ÃÂ± 10 psi. (e) Slowly decrease the pressure and make sure that you get this result: Result: 1 The by-pass valve (14) closes with 55 psi (minimum). (f) Remove the filter bowl and the dummy filter element. (g) Disconnect the hose (3) of the hand pump from the refill port of the reservoir (7). Refer to Figure 501. (h) Install the return filter element (8). Refer to AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Before you install the filter bowl, fill it with hydraulic fluid. (2) Do steps (a) thru (h) for hydraulic system 2. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-005-A (1) Make sure that the reservoirs are full. If necessary, fill them ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-801-A/300). (2) Pressurize the hydraulic systems and make sure that there are no leaks. (3) Install access panels 193BL (SYS 1) and 193CR (SYS 2) back (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100).
