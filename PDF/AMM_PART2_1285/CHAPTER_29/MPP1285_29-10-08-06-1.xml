			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Visually Check Differential Pressure Indications for Red Pins Popped Out (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 211-002-A (1) Do an inspection of the differential pressure indicators to see if the red pin is out. Do an inspection of these filters: • Pressure filter. • Return filter. • Case drain filter. (2) If the red pin is found moved out, do as follows: (a) Remove the filter element related to that pin. (b) Examine the filter element and the hydraulic fluid contained in the filter bowl: NOTE: Contamination in the pressure or in the case drain filter, especially bronze chips, shows defect in the hydraulic pump. 1 If contamination is found in the hydraulic fluid, in the pressure or in the case drain filter, replace the hydraulic pump (AMM TASK 29-10-03-000-801- A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-03-400-801-A/400), the filter element ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400) and flush the related hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-00-01-910-801-A/ 200). 2 If the contamination is found in the return filter, replace the filter ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400). 3 If no contamination is found in the filter element or in the hydraulic fluid contained in the filter bowl, replace the filter ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400). (c) Reset the red pin. (d) Turn on the hydraulic pump (EMDP) and control such systems as rudder, aileron, or brake. (e) If the red pin comes out of its seat again, replace the related red pin assembly AMM TASK 29-30-03-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-30-03-400-801-A/400. K.

Visually Check Differential Pressure Indicators for Red Pins Popped Out (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 211-003-A (1) Do an inspection of the differential pressure indicators to see if the red pin is moved out. Do an inspection of these filters: • Pressure filter. • Return filter. • Case drain filter. (2) If any of the red pins are out of their seats proceed as follows: (a) Reset the red pin moved out. (b) Make an entry in the aircraft logbook to show which pin was moved out, and the date when it occurred. (c) Turn on the hydraulic pump (EMDP) and control such systems as rudder, aileron, or brake. (d) Check if the same pin moves out of its seat. (e) If so, remove the filtering element related to that pin ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400). Examine the filter element and the hydraulic fluid contained in the filter bowl: NOTE: Contamination in the pressure or case drain filter, especially bronze chips, shows defect in the hydraulic pump. 1 If contamination is found in the hydraulic fluid, in the pressure or in the case drain filter, replace the hydraulic pump (AMM TASK 29-10-03-000-801- A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-03-400-801-A/400), the filter element ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400) and flush the related hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-00-01-910-801-A/ 200). 2 If contamination is found in return filter, replace the filter ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400). 3 If no contamination is found in the filter element or in the hydraulic fluid contained in the filter bowl, replace the filter ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/400). 4 Note on the aircraft logbook that the filtering element was replaced. 5 Reset the red pin. 6 Turn on the hydraulic pump (EMDP) and control such systems as rudder, aileron, or brake.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 7 If the same red pin comes out of its seat, replace the related red pin assembly ( AMM TASK 29-30-03-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-30-03-400-801-A/400). (f) If after the test with the EMDP, the pin does not move out of its seat, the aircraft is permitted to fly for 50 FH. (3) Within 50 FH the following maintenance action is required: (a) On the first opportunity, on a main base, check if the same pin is moved out. (b) If not, no maintenance action is required. Record on the aircraft logbook that after reset the pin, and perform some flights the pin did not move out from its seat, and this issue is closed. (c) If you find the pin moved out, remove the filtering element related to that pin ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 29-10-08-400-801-A/ 400).
