			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE Hydraulic compartment of system 1 and 1 Does the task system 2 I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Remove access panel(s) 193BL and/or 193CR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (2) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Isolate the operational areas near the landing gear, rudder, spoiler, thrust reverser, ailerons, and flaps. (4) Make sure that on the circuit breaker panel the EMDP 1 and/or EMDP 2 circuit breaker(s) is (are) closed. (5) Make sure that the safety pins are installed on the landing gears. J. Operational Check of the Reservoir Relief/Bleed Valve SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do this step to operational check of the reservoir relief/bleed valve for aircraft PRE- MOD SB145-29-0011 (Figure 501). (a) Disconnect the drain tube from the electric motor-driven pump drain port. (b) Install a plug in the drain tube end. (c) Connect a length of hose to the hydraulic compartment drain and have a drip pan at the free end of the hose. (d) Set the control switch of the EMDP to on. (e) Pull the bleed valve lever to open the valve. 1 Make sure that air-free oil is drained through the hose into the drip pan. (f) Release the bleed valve lever to close the valve. (g) Examine the valve for leaks. (h) Set the control switch of the EMDP to off. (i) Remove the hose from the hydraulic compartment drain. (j) Remove the plug from the drain tube end. (k) Connect the drain tube to the EMDP. (2) Do this step to operational check of the reservoir relief/bleed valve for aircraft POST- MOD SB145-29-0011 (Figure 502).
