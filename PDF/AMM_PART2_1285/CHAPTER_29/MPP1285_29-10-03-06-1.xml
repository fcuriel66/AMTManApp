			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 29-10-03-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. EDP - INSPECTION A. General (1) This inspection/check procedure is applicable when a loss of hydraulic fluid from the hydraulic reservoir is detected. NOTE: The limit of the shaft seal leakage for the EDP is five (5) drops in ten (10) minutes (refer to Vickers CMM 29-11-15). Thus, if the engines operate during a sufficiently long period, the sight glass will be filled with hydraulic fluid. Sometimes, the hydraulic fluid is mixed with some engine oil. If this occurs the component leakage limits must be analyzed separately (refer to RRA FIM CSP34064, chapter 79-37-00). B.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Open the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-000-801-A/400). J. Inspection of EDP SUBTASK 280-002-A (1) If the EDP was operated for less than 15 minutes with empty reservoir, no action is necessary. (2) If the EDP was operated for more than 15 minutes and less than 1 hour with empty reservoir, do as follows: (a) Remove the case drain and pressure filter bowl ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-000-801- A/400) and visually examine the hydraulic fluid for contamination. 1 Decontaminate the hydraulic fluid ( AMM TASK 29-00-01-910-801-A/200), if the presence of metallic particles is detected in it. (b) Remove the mechanical hydraulic pump (AMM TASK 29-10-03-000-801-A/400). 1 Drain the hydraulic fluid from the EDP. If metallic particles are detected, discard the pump. 2 Make sure that the torque necessary to move the EDP shaft is a maximum of 2.0 N.m (18.0 lb.in). For a continuous rotation, the torque necessary is a maximum of 1.5 N.m (13.0 lb.in). If the torque is higher than one of these two values, discard the pump. (3) If the EDP was operated for more than 1 hour with empty reservoir, do as follows: (a) Replace the pump (AMM TASK 29-10-03-000-801-A/400) and (AMM TASK 29-10-03-400-801-A/400). (b) Visually examine the pump filters ( AMM TASK 29-10-08-200-801-A/600). (c) Decontaminate the hydraulic fluid ( AMM TASK 29-00-01-910-801-A/200), if metallic particles are detected in it. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-400-801-A/400). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 29-10-03 Page 3 of 3 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
