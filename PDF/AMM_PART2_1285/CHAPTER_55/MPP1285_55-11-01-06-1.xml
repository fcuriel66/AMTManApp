General (1) This task gives the procedure to do the general visual inspection of the two bonding jumpers, installed between the horizontal and the vertical stabilizers. (2) A General Visual Inspection (GVI) is a visual examination of an interior or exterior area, installation or assembly to find obvious damage, failure or irregular conditions. (3) Examine the components for correct mounting or attachment to the related support or adjacent equipment. Look for unsatisfactory safetying, clamp looseness, misalignment, loose electrical connections, missing rivets, bolts or screws, and loose connections or hinges. (4) Examine the structural parts for loose rivets, nicks, dents, cracks, separation of bonding, corrosion, jamming, cleaning, erosion, deformation, warp, deteriorated protective treatment, and overheating.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Tail boom I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Set the Pitch Trim to FULL NOSE DOWN (DN 4). Thus, the horizontal stabilizer leading edge will be fully UP. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the PITCH TRIM 1 circuit breaker and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (3) On the left electrical power control/distribution box, open the PITCH TRIM 1 circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (4) On the right electrical power control/distribution box, open the PITCH TRIM 2 circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (5) Put a DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-HORIZONTAL-STABILIZER sign on the pitch trim panel, in the cockpit. (6) NOTE: It is not necessary to remove the two seal fairings. Remove only one, the LH or RH seal fairing. Remove the RH or the LH seal fairing ( AMM TASK 55-36-00-000-801-A/400). J. Horizontal-to-Vertical-Stabilizers Bonding Jumpers - Visual Inspection (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 212-002-A (1) Make sure that the two bonding jumpers are correctly mounted and look for signs of elongation, misalignment, or other damage. (a) If there is damage, replace the bonding jumper. Refer to AMM TASK 55-11-01-000-801-A/400. (2) Examine the two bonding jumpers to know if they are mechanically tensioned. (a) If the slack is less than 5 mm, replace the bonding jumper. Refer to AMM TASK 55-11-01-000-801-A/400. (3) Examine the two supports, that connect the bonding jumpers to the horizontal stabilizer for deformation and signs of cracks or ruptures. (a) If damage was found or if the deformation is more than 30 degrees, replace the support. Refer to IPC 55-11-01. (4) If the bonding jumper connecting support has a deformation angle of less than 30 degrees, examine its painting for general conditions. CAUTION: THE SUPPORT MUST STAY AS YOU FOUND IT (DO NOT RETURN THE SUPPORT TO THE ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION). (a) If damage was found, refer to CPM 51-21-07 and restore the support painting.
