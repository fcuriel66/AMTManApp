Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Elevator tips I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Install the elevator tip (2). Refer to (Figure 401); DET. B. CAUTION:IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DO THE STATIC BALANCING OF THE ELEVATORS WHEN AN OLD ELEVATOR TIP FAIRING IS REPLACED BY A NEW ONE. (2) Install the screws (1) that attach the elevator tip (2) to its frame. Refer to (Figure 401); DET. B. NOTE: For the torque, refer to AMM MPP 20-10-01/200. (3) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing between the elevator tip (2) and its frame. Use the applicable procedure as necessary. (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. NOTE: The sealant curing time will change with the environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (b) Acceleration of sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: The sealant curing time will change with the environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (c) Application of aluminum tape after the tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a fast aircraft clearance is necessary.
