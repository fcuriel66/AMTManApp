			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Removal (Figure 401)  (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 020-002-A (1) Remove the screws (1) that attach the vertical-stabilizer leading edge (2) to the vertical stabilizer. (2) Remove the vertical-stabilizer leading edge (2). (3) Remove the old aerodynamic sealant and prepare the surface, according to SRM 51-20-01-PR. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (4) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the surface. (5) Examine the bonding metallic plate for general condition. Replace it if necessary. Refer to Figure 402. NOTE: If it is necessary to replace the bonding metallic plate, use a wooden tool as a wedge for the separation of the bonding metallic plate from the surface of the electric contacts.

Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Install the bonding metallic plate. Refer to (Figure 402): (a) With a Scotch Brite sponge, sand the surface of the electric contacts where the bonding metallic plate will be bonded. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (b) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the area of the electric contacts where the bonding metallic plate will be bonded. (c) Remove the release film from the bonding metallic plate. NOTE: Do not warp or twist the bonding metallic plate. (d) Install the bonding metallic plate on the electric contacts. (2) Install the vertical-stabilizer leading edge (2). (3) Install the screws (1) that attach the vertical-stabilizer leading edge (2) to the vertical stabilizer. NOTE: For torque, refer to (AMM MPP 20-10-01/200). (4) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing between the vertical- stabilizer leading edge (2) and the vertical stabilizer itself. Use the applicable procedure as necessary. (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Sealant curing time will vary according to environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (b) Acceleration of sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: Sealant curing time will vary according to environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (c) Application of aluminum tape after tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as indicated in paragraph (b). 3 After sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 150 hours. (d) Application of polyethylene film and aluminum tape. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Apply a polyethylene film over the sealant. 3 Apply the aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 10 days. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Do the electrical-bonding test procedure as given in AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/ 200.
