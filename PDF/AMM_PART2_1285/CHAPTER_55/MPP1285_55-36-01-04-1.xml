			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Clean the inside and the outside of the tail-boom light lens (2) with a flannel soaked with naphtha. (2) Apply Molykote DC-33 light grease to the faying surface of the tail-boom light lens (2). (3) Install the tail-boom light lens (2). (4) Install the screws (1). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing between the tail boom fairing and the tail-boom light lens (2). Use the applicable procedure as necessary. (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant PR2050 B1/2. NOTE: Sealant curing time will vary according to environment conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01. (b) Acceleration of sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant PR2050 B1/2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: Sealant curing time versus temperature rate varies as shown in the Sealant Specification Table SRM 51-20-01. (c) Application of aluminum tape after tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant PR2050 B1/2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as indicated in paragraph (b). 3 Once sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove aluminum tape after 150 hours. (d) Application of polyethylene film and aluminum tape. 1 Apply sealant PR2050 B1/2. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 55-36-01 Page 6 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 Apply a polyethylene film over the sealant. 3 Apply the aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 10 days. (2) Remove the workstand from the work area. (3) Remove the DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-HORIZONTAL-STABILIZER sign from the pitch trim panel. (4) On the circuit breaker panel, close the PITCH TRIM 1 and 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them. (5) On the left electrical power control/distribution box, close the PITCH TRIM 1 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (6) On the right electrical power control/distribution box, close the PITCH TRIM 2 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it.
