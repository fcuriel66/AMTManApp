			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Set the gust lock system to the unlock position. (2) Remove rear fairings of the horizontal stabilizer. Refer to AMM TASK 55-36-00-000-801-A/400. (3) Remove the spring-cartridge position mechanism. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-14-000-801-A/400. J. Removal SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE RUDDER, HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, AND ELEVATOR CANNOT BE ACCIDENTALLY OPERATED. AN ACCIDENTAL OPERATION CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. (1) Remove the bolts (1) and (2), washers (4) and (6), and nuts (5) and (3) to release the support from the horizontal stabilizer structure. Refer to Figure 401. (2) Keep the removed shims (7), (8) and (9) for the support installation. NOTE: These shims are necessary to keep the gust lock device aligned. If there are damaged shims, write their thickness and install (installation procedure) new shims with the same thickness as the shims removed to keep the system alignment. (3) With an acrylic spatula, remove the old sealant. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (4) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the surface.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL G. Expendable Parts IPC REFERENCE ITEM QTY (VENDOR REFERENCE) Secondary Structure IPC 55-12-00 AR H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Mechanics Horizontal stabilizer I. Installation SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is in the same configuration as it was after the removal procedure. CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE SHIMS BETWEEN THE SUPPORT AND HORIZONTAL STABILIZER STRUCTURE HAVE THE SAME THICKNESS AND ARE INSTALLED IN THE SAME POSITION AS THEY WERE BEFORE THE REMOVAL. THIS IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE GUST-LOCK SYSTEM ALIGNMENT. (2) Install the support in the horizontal stabilizer structure with the bolts (1) and (2), shims (7), (8) and (9), washers (4) and (6) and nuts (3) and (5). Refer to Figure 401. (3) Tighten the bolts (1). Refer to Figure 401. NOTE: Apply a torque of 2.5 - 4.3 N.m (22 - 38 lbf.in). WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SEALANTS. FOR HAZARD, PROTECTION, AND HANDLING OF MATERIAL, REFER TO ITS MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET. (4) Apply Sealant P/S 870C-12. NOTE: The sealant curing time changes with the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the spring-cartridge position mechanism. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-14-400-801-A/400. (2) Do the operational check of the electromechanical gust-lock system. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-00-700-801-A/500. (3) Do the operational check of the electromechanical actuator. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-01-700-801-A/500. If the check of the actuator is not OK, do a check on the components of the electromechanical gust-lock mechanism for too large internal friction forces (FIM TASK 27-70-00-810-808-A).
