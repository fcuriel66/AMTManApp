			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Open access panel(s) 191EL and/or 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100), as applicable. J. Repair the Thermal Insulation of the Cooling Pack System (Figure 201)  (Figure 202)  SUBTASK 900-002-A WARNING:DO NOT TOUCH THE COOLING PACK SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF. THE HIGH AIR TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. CAUTION: IF IT IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE A DUCT SECTION OR COMPONENT TO REPAIR THE THERMAL INSULATION, PUT PLASTIC PLUGS AT THE DUCT ENDS AS A PROTECTION. (1) NOTE: If the damaged area of the thermal insulation is too large, you can optionally remove the old thermal insulation and install the new insulation type, as installed on aircraft S/N 170 and on. Refer to IPC 21-51-00 and AMM TASK 21-51-11-960-801-A/200. If necessary, remove the duct or component to do the repair. (2) Remove the damaged portion of the thermal insulation. (3) Apply a layer of ceramic fiber insulation to the part to be repaired. (4) Attach the duct ceramic fiber insulation with tape. Make sure that the part to be repaired is covered and attached with tape. NOTE: Attach the duct ceramic fiber insulation with tapes as follows: • On straight parts, use large tape. • On the curved parts, use narrow tape. (5) At the ducts, air cycle machine (ACM), or dual heat exchanger, wind tape around the ceramic fiber insulation, until the blanket is totally covered and attached. NOTE: The new turns must make correct overlaps on the old turns. (6) Insulation finishing at tube ends (Figure 202): • Use narrow tape. • Start the tape application on the layer of large tape, and do one complete rotation parallel to the end of the insulation fiber layer. • Continue to apply the tape to the metallic surface of the tube, and do two complete rotations, while you hold the tape firmly. • Go with the tape rearward to above the insulation (ceramic fiber insulation + tape), and do two complete rotations. • Cut the tape and make sure that the tape end bonds well to the insulation.
