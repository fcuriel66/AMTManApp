			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Remove and keep the connection (7). (2) Remove and discard the old O-ring (6). (3) Install a new O-ring (6). (4) Install the connection (7). J. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Put the clamps (1) and (5) on the tubes of the water collector (4). (2) Put the water collector (4) in its installation position and connect its tubes. NOTE: Before installation, make sure that the duct flanges and clamps are in good conditions (AMM MPP 21-51-14/600). If any duct and/or clamp shows signs of damage, replace it (them) as applicable. (3) Use a torque wrench to torque the clamps (1) and (5) to 5.65 - 6.21 N.m (50 - 55 lb.in). NOTE: When you install the clamps (1) and (5), pay attention to the correct position of the inner shield during the torque application, to not block the inner shield tip with the hex bolt head or with the convoluted spring. (4) After the initial torque is complete, use a torque wrench and apply a torque of 5.65 - 6.21 N.m (50 - 55 lb.in) to the clamps (1) and (5) again. (5) Put the clamp (3) on the hose (2). (6) Connect the hose (2) to the water collector (4). (7) Tighten the clamp (3). (8) On aircraft POST-MOD. SB145-21-0018, on the LH side, reinstall the clamp (8) to the water collector, if applicable. Install the screw (9), nut (12), and washers (10) to hold the device (11) with the wiring (ref.) to the clamp (8). (9) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the PACK 1 and PACK 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them. (10) Install access panel 191EL or 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100), as applicable. (11) Do an operational test of the cooling pack system (AMM TASK 21-51-00-700-802-A/ 500). NOTE: Let the cooling packs operate for 5 minutes. WARNING:DO NOT TOUCH THE COOLING PACK SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF. THE HIGH AIR TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO YOU. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 21-51-05 Page 6 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION:BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU HANDLE THE PACKS, VALVES, SENSING ELEMENTS, AND AIR CONDITIONING DUCTS. DO NOT LET OIL, GREASE OR RESIN GET ON THESE COMPONENTS. (12) After the operational test is complete, get access to the water collector again. Remove access panel 191EL or 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100), as applicable. (13) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the PACK 1 and PACK 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (14) Use a torque wrench and apply a torque of 5.65 - 6.21 N.m (50 - 55 lb.in) to the clamps (1) and (5) again. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, close the PACK 1 and/or PACK 2 circuit breaker(s) and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag(s) from it (them), as applicable. (2) Install access panel 191EL or 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100), as applicable. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 21-51-05 Page 7 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
