			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Connect the positive (+) wire of the electrical power supply to the pin A of the electrical connector. (b) Connect the negative (-) wire of the electrical power supply to the pin B of the electrical connector. (c) Monitor the travel of the mark in the end of the motor shaft (refer to VIEW C). (d) Stop the power supply to pin A immediately, when the mark comes to the letter C on the bottom of the air distribution valve. (e) Slowly move the support of the microswitch S1 in the cam direction. (f) Stop the movement immediately when you hear the CLICK of the microswitch (operation indication). (g) Tighten the screws that attach the support of the microswitch (S1). (2) Adjust the open position of the air distribution valve. For this, do the steps below: (a) Connect the positive (+) wire of the electrical power supply to the pin B of the electrical connector. (b) Connect the negative (-) wire of the electrical power supply to the pin A of the electrical connector. (c) Monitor the travel of the mark in the end of the motor shaft (refer to VIEW C). (d) Stop the power supply to pin B immediately, when the mark comes to the letter O on the bottom of the air distribution valve. (e) Slowly move the support of the microswitch S2 in the cam direction. (f) Stop the movement immediately, when you hear the CLICK of the microswitch (operation indication). (g) Tighten the screws that attach the support of the microswitch (S2). K. Follow-on   SUBTASK 842-008-A (1) Install the air distribution valve to the aircraft (AMM TASK 21-22-01-400-802-A/400).
