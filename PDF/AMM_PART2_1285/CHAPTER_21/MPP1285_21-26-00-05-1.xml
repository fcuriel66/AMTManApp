			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 A - Does the task Electronic compartment 1 B - Helps technician A Cockpit I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A SAFE CONDITION BEFORE YOU DO THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. THIS IS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (1) Do the procedure to make the aircraft safe for maintenance ( AMM TASK 20-00-00-910-801-A/200). SUBTASK 841-003-A (2) Remove these access panels, as applicable: • 113AZ (LH shutoff valve) (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). • 114AZ (RH shutoff valve) (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). J. Operationally Check Electronic Compartment Ventilation System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do a check to know if the exhaust fans are in operation: (a) Make sure the exhaustion air comes out through the grilles, on the left and right sides. (b) Make sure that the shutoff valves are open on the left and right sides. NOTE: You can use a mirror and a flashlight to do an inspection on the position of the butterfly shutoff valve. WARNING: WHEN YOU ENERGIZE THE AIRCRAFT THE RECIRCULATION FANS WILL START OPERATION. BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU GET ACCESS TO THE ELECTRONIC COMPARTMENT AND OPEN THE ACCESS DOOR 113 CZ. STAY IN A SAFETY DISTANCE FROM THE RECIRCULATION FAN, TO AVOID INJURY TO YOU AND/OR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENTS. (2) Open access door 113CZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Do a check in the recirculation fans and make sure that they are in operation. They must be in operation during all the check. (4) If the exhaust fans are not in operation, do as follows: WARNING: BE CAREFUL WITH THE HIGH TEMPERATURE WHEN YOU HEAT THE THERMAL SWITCH.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) With a heat gun slowly and continuously heat the two thermal switches simultaneously on the left side to a temperature of more than 24ÃÂ°C (75ÃÂ°F). Result: 1 The exhaust fan on the left side starts the operation. 2 The shutoff valve on the left side opens. (5) On the left side, do as follows: (a) Decrease the temperature of one of the thermal switches with an ice bag, to a temperature below 19ÃÂ°C (66ÃÂ°F). Result: 1 The exhaust fan on the left side stops. 2 The shutoff valve on the left side closes. (6) Do step (4) and (5) for the thermal switches on the right side. NOTE: Examine the shutoff valve and exhaust fan on the right side. (7) Position one mechanic in the cockpit and the other in the nose landing gear compartment. (8) With the overtemperature switch on the left side, do as follows: WARNING: BE CAREFUL WITH THE HIGH TEMPERATURE WHEN YOU HEAT THE THERMAL SWITCH. (a) Slowly and continuously heat the overtemperature switch with a heat gun, to a temperature above 71ÃÂ°C (160ÃÂ°F). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the ELEKBAY OVTEMP caution message. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (b) Push the master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION light goes off. (c) Decrease the temperature of the overtemperature switch, with an ice bag, to less than 71ÃÂ°C (160ÃÂ°F). Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the ELEKBAY OVTEMP caution message goes out of view. (9) Do step (8) for the overtemperature switch on the right side. (10) Close the access door 113CZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the External DC Power Supply from the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Close these access panels, as applicable: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 21-26-00 Page 4 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
