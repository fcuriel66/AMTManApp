J. Cleaning of Dual Heat Exchanger and Visual Check of Core for Condition SUBTASK 170-002-A WARNING: USE CLOTHING AND GOGGLES TO GIVE PROTECTION WHEN YOU CLEAN THE UNIT WITH SOLVENTS AND STEAM. CLEAN IT IN AN AREA THAT HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES OF THE SOLVENTS OR GET THEM ON YOUR SKIN OR IN YOUR EYES BECAUSE THEY CAN CAUSE IRRITATION. STEAM AND COMPRESSED AIR CAN CAUSE INJURY FROM AIRBORNE PARTICLES. CAUTION:DURING ALL PROCEDURES IN WHICH YOU USE PRESSURIZED AIR, STEAM, OR LIQUIDS TO CLEAN DUCTS AND PASSAGES, BE CAREFUL NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE FINS WITH THE WASHER OR ITS FLOW. (1) Before you clean the unit, examine the core to know if there are bent fins. Badly bent fins decrease the flow of air through the core and make it difficult to clean the unit fully. (2) Flow all loose particles out of the core with clean, dry, compressed air at 30 psi. Blow the air in from the exhaust, which is the clean end, through to the inlet, which is the dirty end. (3) Steam-clean the core as follows: CAUTION:USE ONLY AGENTS WHICH WILL NOT CAUSE DAMAGE TO ALUMINUM. AGENTS THAT ARE SAFE TO USE ARE SPECIFIED IN THE "CONSUMABLE MATERIALS" SECTION. BECAUSE WE DO NOT CLEAN CONDENSER AND MIXERS WE CANNOT MAKE AN ANALYSIS OF OTHER AGENTS THAT YOU CAN USE. (a) Use your own hot-water high-pressure washer or a model recommended by the manufacturer in "Tools and Equipment". (b) Adjust the washer wand for steam and a 1% (by volume) solution of Turco 5279A or 5279ANC and water. Refer to "Consumable Materials" for alternative agents.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Flush the steam and detergent solution through the core from the exhaust (clean) end through to the inlet (dirty) end. Continue the flow of solution until it comes out of the inlet. (d) Stop the flow of Turco solution and continue to send steam through the core to flush away the Turco solution. (4) Fully soak the unit in a 17% (by volume) solution of Turco 5975A and water for 24 hours at room temperature. Refer to "Consumable Materials" for alternative agents. For the best results, keep the solution constantly mixed. NOTE: The soak clean step is optional. You can decrease the time of the soak or not include the step if the unit is satisfactorily clean without it. (5) Flush the core, ducts, and surfaces of the unit with clean, room-temperature water to make sure that you remove all of the detergent. (6) Drain the unit and turn it as necessary to remove as much water as possible. (7) Let the unit air-dry. (8) After cleaning, do leakage and pressure drop tests for the unit. Refer to the latest revision of Hamilton Sundstrand CMM 21-51-69. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the dual heat exchangers ( AMM TASK 21-51-02-400-801-A/400).

General WARNING: DURING THE CLEANING PROCEDURE, PREVENT CONTACT WITH THE CLEANING SOLUTION AND DO NOT BREATHE ITS VAPORS OR MISTS. DO THIS PROCEDURE IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. • PUT ON SAFETY CLOTHES, GOGGLES, AND GLOVES. CAUTION: BEFORE YOU START THIS PROCEDURE, MAKE SURE THAT THE ECS IS OFF AND THAT THE HEAT EXCHANGER COOLED TO A MINIMUM OF 23ÃÂ°C (41.4ÃÂ°F) BELOW THE FLASH POINT OF THE CLEANING SOLUTION IN USE. REFER TO THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET (MSDS) OF THE SOLVENT IN USE TO GET THE FLASH POINT. (1) This task gives the procedure to clean the dual heat exchangers on the aircraft. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Remove access panel 191GL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (5) Remove the protective plug from the fan-inlet diffuser housing (FIDH) (Figure 702) to show 2" diameter clean-out access hole. NOTE: Do an inspection on the protective plug to know if it is necessary to replace it. If it is in good condition, keep it. (6) Prepare the cleaning solution with one of the cleaning solvents listed in Consumable Materials table above. The recommended concentrations for all cleaning solvents are: • 1 part cleaning solvent with 5 to 10 parts water for light to moderate soils. • 1 part cleaning solvent with 2 to 5 parts water for heavy soils. • 1 part cleaning solvent with 1 to 4 parts water for heavy soils, grease, and carbon deposits. J. Clean Dual Heat Exchanger on the Aircraft SUBTASK 170-003-A (1) Opposite flow flush the ram air circuit (heat exchanger core), from the FIDH access hole to the ram air inlet face, with the use of the cleaning solution at a pressure of 20 to 30 PSIG, for a minimum of 10 minutes. (2) Make sure that the full core face surface is flushed. (3) Fully flush the solvent from the ram air circuit (heat exchanger core), from the FIDH access hole to the ram air inlet face, with the use of clean water only, at 30 PSIG maximum pressure. (4) Continue water flush until the water is clean as it exits the ram air inlet face of the heat exchanger. (5) Blow dry with clean air. NOTE: You can use a dry compressed air source with a maximum pressure of 30 psi. (6) Make sure that the aircraft ram-air inlet duct is free of residual water and debris. K. Follow-on (Figure 701)  (Figure 702)  SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Install the protective plug on the fan-inlet diffuser housing (FIDH) access hole (Figure 702). (2) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is a part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations (Section 6) of the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRB). (3) Install access panel 191GL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100).
