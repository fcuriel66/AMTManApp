			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL STATIC PORT LINES - CLEANING/PAINTING EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to clean the static port lines. B. The cleaning of the static port lines is done with the application of dry air or dry nitrogen with a pressure equivalent to 25 psi to the tubing and to the static ports. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation (Figure 701)  SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach DO- NOT-CLOSE tags to them: • STATIC PORT 1 (Location tip: DC BUS 1 / ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION / STATIC PORT 1). • STATIC PORT 2 (Location tip: DC BUS 2 / ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION / STATIC PORT 2). (2) Open access door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Remove floor access panel 272CF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (4) Remove the four P0 sensors (6) (AMM TASK 73-25-01-000-801-A/400). (5) Remove the static port tubes (1). (6) Disconnect the static port tubes (3) from the electropneumatic outflow valve (5) and from the pneumatic outflow valve (4). (7) Install plastic caps on the electropneumatic outflow valve (5) and on the pneumatic outflow valve (4) fittings. J. Clean Static Port Lines (Figure 701)  SUBTASK 160-002-A (1) Connect the hose of a nitrogen cylinder or of a clean and dry compressed air source to the tube ends which were connected to the static port tubes (1). (2) Apply dry nitrogen or dry air at 25-psi pressure into the tubes, in the static port-to- sensor and outflow valve direction. (3) Make sure that the lines are not clogged and that the nitrogen or air can flow freely. (4) Connect the hose of a nitrogen cylinder or of a clean and dry compressed air source to the static port (2) fittings which were connected to the static port tubes (1). (5) Apply dry nitrogen or dry air at 25-psi pressure into the static ports (2), in the static port-to-overboard direction. (6) Make sure that the static ports (2) are not clogged and that the nitrogen or air can flow freely. (7) Connect the hose of a nitrogen cylinder or of a clean and dry compressed air source to the static port tubes (1), which were removed from the aircraft. (8) Apply dry nitrogen or dry air at 25-psi pressure into the tubes. (9) Make sure that the tubes are not clogged and that the nitrogen or air can flow freely.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the plastic caps from the electropneumatic outflow valve (5) and from the pneumatic outflow valve (4) fittings. (2) Connect the static port tubes (3) to the electropneumatic outflow valve (5) and to the pneumatic outflow valve (4). (3) Install the static port tubes (1). (4) Install the four P0 sensors (6) (AMM TASK 73-25-01-400-801-A/400). (5) Install floor access panel 272CF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (6) Close access door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (7) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tags from the circuit breakers below and close them: • STATIC PORT 1 (Location tip: DC BUS 1 / ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION / STATIC PORT 1). • STATIC PORT 2 (Location tip: DC BUS 2 / ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION / STATIC PORT 2). (8) Do the Functional Test of Overpressurization Relief Devices (AMM TASK 21-31-00-700-807-A/500) or the Functional Test of Overpressurization Relief Devices with Pitot/Static System Test Set (AMM TASK 21-31-00-700-809-A/500).
