			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A SAFE CONDITION BEFORE YOU DO THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. THIS IS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE COOLING PACK SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF. THE HIGH AIR TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO YOU. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU HANDLE THE PACKS, VALVES, SENSING ELEMENTS, AND AIR CONDITIONING DUCTS. DO NOT LET OIL, GREASE OR RESIN GET ON THESE COMPONENTS. (1) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the PACK 1 and PACK 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (2) Remove access panels as applicable: • 191KL and 191EL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100), for the LH dual temperature control valve. • 191LR and 191 FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100), for the RH dual temperature control valve. J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE BLEED-AIR SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ENGINE OR APU STOPS. THE HIGH TEMPERATURE OF THE BLEED-AIR CAN CAUSE INJURIES TO PERSONS.
