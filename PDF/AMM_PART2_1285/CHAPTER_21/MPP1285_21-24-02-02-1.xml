Preparation (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Remove the recirculation system mufflers ( AMM TASK 21-24-02-000-801-A/400). (2) With a pen, mark two points (1 and 2) on the coupling base, at the correct coordinates. NOTE: Points must be 90ÃÂ° from each other. (3) Also mark two points (1 and 2) on the flange of the recirculation fan, where the duct will be attached to. (4) Then mark two points (1 and 2) on the flanges of the duct. NOTE: Make sure that the points of the two duct flanges are aligned. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 910-801-A/200 21-24-02 Page 2 of 4 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Installation of the Conditioned Air Noise Attenuator Ducts (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 861-002-A (1) Put the noise attenuator duct in position. (2) Attach the noise attenuator duct to the coupling installed at the structure of the aircraft. NOTE: • Make sure that the point 1 marked on the duct is aligned with the point 1 marked on the base of the coupling. Thus, the point 2 of the duct must also be aligned with the point 2 of the coupling. • When you use the clamp to attach the duct to the coupling, make sure that the went beyond of area of the coupling. (3) Attach the noise attenuator duct to the recirculation fan. NOTE: • Make sure that the point 1 marked on the duct is aligned with the point 1 marked on the fan flange. Thus, the point 2 of the duct must also be aligned with point the 2 of the fan flange. • When you use the clamp to attach the duct to the coupling, make sure that went beyond of area of the coupling. (4) Do the installation procedure again for the duct on the other side. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the recirculation system mufflers ( AMM TASK 21-24-02-400-801-A/400).
