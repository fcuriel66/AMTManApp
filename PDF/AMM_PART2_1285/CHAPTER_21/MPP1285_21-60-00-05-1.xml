			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 A - Does the task Cockpit 1 B - Helps technician A Cockpit and passenger cabin I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Remove floor access panel 251BF or 241DF, as applicable (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100 and AMM TASK 53-01-02-000-802-A/400). (2) Supply pneumatic energy ( AMM TASK 36-00-00-860-801-A/200) or ( AMM TASK 36-00-00-860-802-A/200). (3) Set the ECS page on MFD1 (2) (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1). (4) Set these switches as follows: (a) RECIRC switch - OFF. (b) GASPER switch - OFF. J. Operationally Check Temperature Control (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) The steps below refer to the operational check of the cockpit temperature control. (2) Set the PACK 1 switch to ON. (3) Set the CKPT temperature selector to MAN. (a) Turn the CKPT temperature selector knob clockwise up to 1 - 3 o'clock position, and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. NOTE: Do not turn the selector knob further 3 o'clock position or fully clockwise to prevent incorrect behavior/results on the operational test. Result:  1 The air flow through the general outlets becomes hot. (b) Turn the CKPT temperature selector knob fully counterclockwise and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the general outlets becomes cold. (4) Set the CKPT temperature selector to AUTO. (a) With an ice bag, decrease the temperature of the cockpit temperature sensor down to less than 18ÃÂ°C (64.4ÃÂ°F) (See on the ECS page, on the MFD). (b) Turn the CKPT temperature selector knob fully clockwise and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the general outlets becomes hot.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) With a thermogun, increase the temperature of the cockpit temperature sensor to more than 30ÃÂ°C (86ÃÂ°F) (See on the ECS page, on the MFD). (d) Turn the CKPT temperature selector knob fully counterclockwise and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the general outlets becomes cold. (5) Set the PACK 1 switch to OFF. (6) Set the CKPT temperature selector to the intermediate position. (7) The steps below refer to the operational check of the passenger-cabin temperature control. NOTE: In the passenger cabin, the cold air flows through the outlets in the upper position and the hot air flows through the outlets in the lower position. (8) Set the PACK 2 switch to ON. (9) Set the PASS CABIN temperature selector to MAN. (a) Turn the PASS CABIN temperature selector knob clockwise up to 1 - 3 o'clock position, and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. NOTE: Do not turn the selector knob further 3 o'clock position or fully clockwise to prevent incorrect behavior/results on the operational test. Result:  1 The air flow through the lower outlets becomes hot. (b) Turn the PASS CABIN temperature selector knob fully counterclockwise and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the upper outlets becomes cold. (10) Set the PASS CABIN temperature selector to AUTO. (a) With an ice bag, decrease the temperature of the passenger-cabin temperature sensor down to less than 18ÃÂ°C (64.4ÃÂ°F) (See on the ECS page, on the MFD). (b) Turn the PASS CABIN temperature selector knob fully clockwise and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the lower outlets becomes hot. (c) With a thermogun, increase the temperature of the passenger-cabin temperature sensor to more than 30ÃÂ°C (86ÃÂ°F) (See on the ECS page, on the MFD). (d) Turn the PASS CABIN temperature selector knob fully counterclockwise and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the upper outlets becomes cold. (11) Set the PASS CABIN temperature selector to the ATTD position. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 21-60-00 Page 4 of 8 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (12) With the passenger-cabin temperature control on the flight attendant panel (CABIN TEMP CONTROL light (2) ON): (a) With an ice bag, decrease the temperature of the passenger-cabin temperature sensor down to less than 18ÃÂ°C (64.4ÃÂ°F) (See on the ECS page, on the MFD). (b) Move the CABIN TEMP CONTROL knob (1) fully to the HOT position and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the lower outlets becomes hot. (c) With a thermogun, increase the temperature of the passenger-cabin temperature sensor to more than 30ÃÂ°C (86ÃÂ°F) (See on the ECS page, on the MFD). (d) Move the CABIN TEMP CONTROL knob (1) fully to the COLD position and keep it in this position for 2 minutes. Result:  1 The air flow through the upper outlets becomes cold. (13) Set the PACK 2 switch to OFF. (14) Set the PASS CABIN temperature selector to the intermediate position. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Shut off the pneumatic energy ( AMM TASK 36-00-00-860-801-A/200) or ( AMM TASK 36-00-00-860-802-A/200). (2) Install floor access panel 251BF or 241DF, as applicable (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100 and AMM TASK 53-01-02-400-802-A/400).
