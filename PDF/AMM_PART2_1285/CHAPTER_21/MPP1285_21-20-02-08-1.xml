(2) Remove the thermal switches (AMM TASK 21-20-02-000-801-A/400). (3) Remove the ducts shown (Figure 801, sheet 1). Refer to AMM TASK 21-20-04-000-801-A/400. J. Repair to Improve the Thermal Switch Attachment SUBTASK 300-002-A (1) For a better attachment of the thermal switch, do as follows: (a) Partially remove the thermal insulation from the ducts. Refer to Figure 801, sheet 1. (b) With the aid of an spatula, carefully remove the switch bracket and keep it to be used again. (c) With the aid of 240-grit sandpaper, remove the remaining adhesive from the work area in the duct (Figure 801, sheet 1). (d) Clean the repair area with isopropyl alcohol. (e) Prepare the adhesive mixture (HE 1908) in the proportion of 100 x 85 as shown on the product label. NOTE: Application time is 15 minutes. (f) Bond the bracket to the duct with the prepared adhesive mixture. (g) Cure at 15ÃÂ°C - 25ÃÂ°C (59ÃÂ°F - 77ÃÂ°F) ambient temperature for 48 hours or accelerate the cure with lamps at 60ÃÂ°C - 70ÃÂ°C (140ÃÂ°F - 158ÃÂ°F) for 2 hours.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (h) Use isopropyl alcohol to clean the repair area and the bracket . (i) Prepare two pieces of style-7781 fiberglass fabric with 57mm x 82mm (2.25 in x 3.25 in) in size. Refer to Figure 801, sheet 1. (j) Apply mold release P/N FREKOTE 33-GAL, QZ-11-1, FREKOTE 700-C, or similar product, to the removed screws and install them back to the bracket. Make sure to keep a clearance of 4 to 6 mm for lamination. Refer to Figure 801, sheet 2. NOTE: The mold release and screws are used to protect the locknut threads. (k) Prepare other adhesive mixture (HE 1908) as given in step (e). (l) Laminate the two layers of fiberglass on the bracket (with the two screws installed). Use a paint brush to apply the prepared mixture. (m) Cure at 15ÃÂ°C - 25ÃÂ°C (59ÃÂ°F - 77ÃÂ°F) ambient temperature for 48 hours or accelerate the cure in the stove (or with the aid of heat lamps) at 60ÃÂ°C - 70ÃÂ°C (140ÃÂ°F - 158ÃÂ°F) for 2 hours. (n) After the curing time, remove the screws from the bracket, smooth the surface with 240-grit sandpaper and, if necessary, enlarge the hole to 4.5 mm (0.18 in). Take care not to cause damage to the locknut threads (Figure 801, sheet 2). (o) With a cutter, open the main hole to 15 mm (0.60 in) (Figure 801, sheet 2). (p) With a wooden stick, remove the remaining mold release as necessary. (q) Clean the holes and locknut threads with isopropyl alcohol. (r) With adhesive tape P/N KB 42/75 or equivalent (P/N = OT-7), repair the thermal insulation cut. Protect the exposed duct as shown in Figure 801, sheet 2. Make sure that there is a clearance for the switch installation. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) For the thermal insulation, refer to AMM TASK 21-20-01-400-801-A/400. (2) Install the thermal switches (AMM TASK 21-20-02-400-801-A/400). (3) Install the reworked ducts. Refer to AMM TASK 21-20-04-400-801-A/400.
