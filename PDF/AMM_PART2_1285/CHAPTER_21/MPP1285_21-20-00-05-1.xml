			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 21-20-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. CONDITIONED AIR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM - OPERATIONAL CHECK A. General (1) This task gives the operational check of the conditioned air distribution system in the cockpit and passenger cabin. (2) The gasper fan always operates on the ground, when the aircraft is energized, independently of the GASPER switch position. (3) The recirculation fan operates on when the RECIRC switch is ON and the related pack valve is open. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL – PACK 1 - OFF. – PACK 2 - OFF. – RECIRC - OFF. – GASPER - OFF. – SHED BUSES - OVRD. – Make sure that the APU GEN pushbutton is in ON position (striped bar off). Result:  1 Air flows through the gaspers. (b) Open the GASPER FAN circuit breaker. Result:  1 The airflow through the gaspers stops. (c) Close the GASPER FAN circuit breaker. (d) Set the switches as follows: – APU BLEED - ON. – PACK 1 - ON. – CKPT temperature selector - AUTO. Result:  1 Air flows through the cockpit general outlets and the gaspers. (e) Set the RECIRC switch to ON. Result:  1 The airflow through the cockpit general outlets increases. (f) Set the RECIRC switch to OFF. Result:  1 The airflow through the cockpit general outlets decreases. (g) Set the PACK 1 switch to OFF. Result:  1 The airflow through the cockpit general outlets stops. (h) Set the switches as follows: – APU BLEED - OFF. – SHED BUSES - AUTO. (2) Do the operational test of the conditioned air distribution in the passenger cabin as follows: (a) Set the switches below as follows: – PACK 1 - OFF. – PACK 2 - OFF. – RECIRC - OFF.

(b) Open the GASPER FAN circuit breaker. Result:  1 The airflow through the gaspers stops. (c) Close the GASPER FAN circuit breaker. (d) Set the switches as follows: – APU BLEED - ON. – XBLEED - OPEN. – PACK 2 - ON. – PASS CABIN temperature selector - MAN. (e) Turn the PASS CABIN temperature selector knob fully counterclockwise and keep it in this position for 3 minutes. Result:  1 The cold air flows through the passenger cabin upper outlets. (f) Set the RECIRC switch to ON. Result:  1 The airflow through the passenger cabin upper outlets increases. (g) Turn the PASS CABIN temperature selector knob clockwise up to 1 - 3 o'clock position, and keep it in this position for 3 minutes. NOTE: Do not turn the selector knob further 3 o'clock position or fully clockwise to prevent incorrect behavior/results on the operational test. Result:  1 The hot air flows through the passenger cabin lower outlets. (h) Set the RECIRC switch to OFF. Result:  1 The airflow through the passenger cabin lower outlets decreases. (i) Set the PACK 2 switch to OFF. Result:  1 The airflow through the passenger cabin outlets stops. (j) Set the switches as follows: – APU BLEED - OFF. – SHED BUSES - AUTO. – XBLEED - AUTO.
