WEAR NEOPRENE GLOVES WITH COTTON LINERS, PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, AND EYE GOGGLES. • IF CHEMICAL CONTACT OCCURS, WASH FULLY WITH WATER. • IF YOU GET A CHEMICAL IN THE EYES, FLUSH THE EYES WITH LARGE QUANTITIES OF WATER AND GET MEDICAL AID. USE MECHANICAL VENTILATION OR RESPIRATORY PROTECTION WHEN YOU DO WORK IN A CONFINED SPACE OR AREA. CAUTION: • REFER TO THE SPECIFIC GLASS FIBER DUCTS REPAIR FOR THE REPAIR LIMITS AND MATERIAL OF THE COMPONENTS BEFORE USING THESE REPAIR INSTRUCTIONS. FAILURE TO COMPLY COULD RESULT IN AN UNACCEPTABLE AND UNAUTHORIZED REPAIR. • ROOM TEMPERATURE REPAIRS MUST NOT BE USED IN STRESS CRITICAL AREAS OR PRIMARY STRUCTURE COMPONENTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WOULD RESULT IN AN INADEQUATE REPAIR. (1) To repair the ducts, you must obey these conditions. (2) Do the steps, that follow: 2 2 (a) If the damaged area is larger than 103.0 cm (16 in ), you must replace the duct. NOTE: The operator must control the total repair area. Embraer suggests that you have a form to control all repairs. Table 804 presents an example of such a form.

Then, you must replace the duct. (3) On the split side of the duct, do as follows: (a) Check the duct in the vicinity of the damage for entry of water, oil, fuel, dirt or other foreign matter. (b) Check for delamination around the damage. (4) To hard damage split , repair as follows: (Figure 802). NOTE: This repair applies to components made from glass fiber. WARNING: WEAR GLOVES AND GOGGLES AND PREVENT CONTACT WITH SOLVENT VAPORS DURING THE CLEANING. (a) Clean up the duct with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to remove dirt, oil, and debris. (b) Do the mark in the area to receive the repair (1), according (Figure 802). (c) Cut out around mark done (2), according (Figure 802). (d) With a 240-grit sandpaper, fully remove the excess material and filler from the area where you will make the repair. (e) Wipe the surface, after you sand it, with a clean shop wipe soaked in ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. NOTE: Be careful not to go through the region that will be repair. 1. Make sure that all excess material burr was removed from the surface. (f) Prepare and apply repair plies according to step 5. (g) Cure according to step 6. (5) To prepare damaged areas, do these steps (Figure 804): WARNING: USE SKIN PROTECTION AND BREATHE CAREFULLY WHEN YOU SAND. SANDING RELEASES A FINE POWDER THAT CAN CAUSE SKIN IRRITATION. BREATHING TOO MUCH OF THIS POWDER CAN CAUSE HEALTH PROBLEMS. (a) After from burr removal on the areas with No. 240 sandpaper, fine abrasive, or trim out the damaged surface. (b) Do a geometric shape (oval, circular, or rectangular), using another piece of the same material (fiberglass). (c) Cut out a piece approximate smaller than split.

(e) Use adhesive HE 1908 in the patch to bonded the path Type 7781 - Fiberglass Fabric (or Type 120 - Fiberglass Fabric, or Type 1581 - Fiberglass Fabric according split). (f) Apply the patch in internal side of the duct. (g) Apply firm, positive pressure and make the surface smooth as necessary to prevent air bubbles. (h) Apply the piece in split. (i) Lightly sand the epoxy resin fill the area between this piece and split, to get a good adhesion. (j) Apply another patch in the other side. (6) To cure the repair, do these steps: WARNING: USE HEAT CURING EQUIPMENT THAT IS PERMITTED BY THE LOCAL FIRE PROTECTION AUTHORITIES. TO PREVENT CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONNEL. (a) Let the repair cure at room temperature. NOTE: • Obey to use the curing time indicated for specified epoxy resin. • Curing time does not include the time necessary for the mold and part to heat up the correct temperature. Curing time is the period after the part has got that temperature. (7) Material substitution for fiberglass, when the "as manufactured" material is not available or not in stock. K.
