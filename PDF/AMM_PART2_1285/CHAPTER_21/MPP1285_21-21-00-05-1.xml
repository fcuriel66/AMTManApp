			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that the circuit breaker VALVES DISPLAY is close. (3) Remove the floor access panels, on the cockpit left and right sides ( AMM TASK 53-01-01-000-801-A/400): – 221CF (Shutoff valve and switch on the LH side). – 222BF (Shutoff valve and switch on the RH side). J. Functionally Check Display Ventilation System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A WARNING: TAKE CARE NOT TO BURN YOURSELF WHEN THE EFIS VENTILATION SWITCH IS HOT. (1) Slowly and continuously heat the temperature switch on the LH side duct with a thermogun until you have a temperature higher than 43.5ÃÂ°C (110ÃÂ°F). (2) Make sure that the shutoff valve is in the close position. Refer to Figure 501. (3) Stop until the temperature decreases to less than 35ÃÂ°C (95ÃÂ°F). (4) Make sure that the shutoff valve is in the open position. Refer to Figure 501. WARNING: TAKE CARE NOT TO BURN YOURSELF WHEN THE EFIS VENTILATION SWITCH IS HOT. (5) Slowly and continuously heat the temperature switch on the RH side duct with a thermogun until you have a temperature higher than 43.5ÃÂ°C (110ÃÂ°F). (6) Make sure that the shutoff valve is in the close position. Refer to Figure 501. (7) Stop until the temperature decreases to less than 35ÃÂ°C (95ÃÂ°F). (8) Make sure that the shutoff valve is in the open position. Refer to Figure 501. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the power supply from the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations of the Aircraft Maintenance Program. (3) Install the floor access panels ( AMM TASK 53-01-01-400-801-A/400): – 221CF (Shutoff valve and switch on the LH side). – 222BF (Shutoff valve and switch on the RH side).
