Preparation (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 841-027-A (1) Connect the ramp interphone to permit communication between the technicians. (2) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the START 1 and START 2 circuit breakers and attach DO-NOT-CLOSE tags to them. (3) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the PACK 1 and PACK 2 circuit breakers. (4) Remove access panels 191KL and 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (5) Disconnect electrical connector P0075 from the LH pack valve and electrical connector P0076 from the RH pack valve. (6) Install the test lamps between pins A and B of electrical connectors P0075 and P0076. (7) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, close the PACK 1 and PACK 2 circuit breakers. (8) Energize the aircraft with the external DC power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (9) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, make sure the FADEC 1A, FADEC 1B, FADEC 2A and FADEC 2B circuit breakers are in the closed position. (10) Make sure that the thrust levers are in the IDLE position. (11) On the EICAS display, make sure that one of these thrust rating mode messages is shown: T/O-1 or T/O or T/O RSV or ET/O or ET/O RSV (AMM SDS 76-12-00/1). J. Operationally Check Cooling Pack System to Verify ECS OFF Signal (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  (Figure 504)  SUBTASK 710-016-B WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE DUCTS OR COMPONENTS OF THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF. THE HIGH AIR TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. NOTE: • For the temperature limits for the ECS OFF signal activation, refer to Figure 503. • On aircraft with AE 3007 A and A1/1 engine models, the ECS OFF signal will be activated at temperatures (TAT) above − 18ÃÂ°C (− 0.4ÃÂ°F) (graphic areas 1 and 2). • On aircraft with other AE 3007 engine models, the ECS OFF signal will be activated at temperatures (TAT) above 19ÃÂ°C (66ÃÂ°F) at sea level; then it decreases linearly to − 5ÃÂ°C (23ÃÂ°F) at 9,700 ft (graphic area 1).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 Make sure that the test lamps stay off. (k) On the AIR CONDITIONING/PNEUMATIC control panel, on the overhead panel, set the PACK 1 and PACK 2 pushbuttons to OFF and then set them to ON again. Refer to Figure 501 DET. C. Result: 1 Make sure that the test lamps come on. (2) Under the condition "Ambient Temperature X Pressure Altitude" out of the graphic area 1 of the ECS OFF SIGNAL ENVELOPE (Figure 503), refer to Figure 504 and do as follows: CAUTION: TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION OF THE SYSTEM, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO FOREIGN MATERIALS IN THE STATIC PRESSURE PORTS OR IN THE ADAPTERS, BEFORE THE CONNECTION OF THE TEST SET. (a) Connect the output static port of the test set to anemometric static ports 2 and 4 (or to anemometric static ports 1 and 3). Refer to Figure 504 DET. C. NOTE: This procedure can cause interference with the local air traffic during simulations of altitude with the anemometric bench test. To prevent this, make sure that the transponder is on the STANDBY condition (AMM SDS 34-52-00/1). (b) Connect the adapters (or adhesive tape) to seal anemometric static ports 1 and 3 (or 2 and 4) and attach REMOVE-BEFORE-FLIGHT tags to them. Refer to Figure 504 DET. D. (c) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the PRESS CONTROL circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it (Location tip: DC BUS 1/AIR COND/ PNEU/PRESS CONTROL). (d) Set the altitude of the PITOT/STATIC SYSTEM TEST SET to make the "Ambient Temperature X Pressure Altitude" value to be in the envelope (1). Refer to Figure 503 and do step (1) again. NOTE: Make sure that the altitude is not more than 9700ft and the climb rate is not more than 3500 ft/min on the PITOT/STATIC SYSTEM TEST SET and the PFD. (e) After step (1) is completed, remove the adapters, PITOT/STATIC SYSTEM TEST SET, and REMOVE-BEFORE-FLIGHT tag or adhesive tape. Refer to Figure 504. (f) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, close the PRESS CONTROL circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag. K. Follow-on (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 842-027-A (1) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).

(1) Do the check as follows: (a) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, close the PACK 1 circuit breaker. (b) On the AIR CONDITIONING/PNEUMATIC control panel on the overhead panel, set the PACK 1 pushbutton to ON. (c) On the P0075 connector, measure the voltage between A (-) and B (+) pins. Result: 1 The voltage must be 28 ÃÂ± 2 V DC. (d) On the P0075 connector, measure the voltage between A (-) and C (+) pins. Result: 1 The voltage must be 28 ÃÂ± 2 V DC.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (e) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, close the WING circuit breaker. (f) On the ICE PROTECTION control panel on the overhead panel, set the WING pushbutton to ON. (g) On the P0981 connector, make a jumper from E pin to F pin. (h) On the P0075 connector, measure the voltage between the A (-) and B (+) pins. Result: 1 The voltage must be 28 ÃÂ± 2 V DC. (i) On the P0075 connector, measure the voltage between the A (-) and C (+) pins. Result: 1 The voltage must be 28 ÃÂ± 2 V DC. (j) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, close the PACK 2 circuit breaker. (k) On the AIR CONDITIONING/PNEUMATIC control panel on the overhead panel, set the PACK 2 pushbutton to ON. (l) On the P0076 connector, make a jumper from E pin to F pin. (m) On the ICE PROTECTION control panel on the overhead panel, set the STAB pushbutton to ON. NOTE: Make sure that the STAB circuit breaker is closed, on the overhead circuit breaker panel. (n) On the ICE PROTECTION control panel on the overhead panel, set the OVERRIDE switch to ALL position. (o) On the ICE PROTECTION control panel on the overhead panel, set the TEST switch to 1 or 2 position. (p) On the P0075 connector, measure the voltage between the A (-) and B(+) pins. Result: 1 The voltage must be 0 V DC. (q) On the ICE PROTECTION control panel on the overhead panel, release the TEST switch. (r) On the ICE PROTECTION control panel on the overhead panel, return the OVERRIDE switch to AUTO position. (s) On the ICE PROTECTION control panel on the overhead panel, set the STAB pushbutton to OFF. (t) On the P0075 connector, measure the voltage between the A (-) and C (+) pins. Result: 1 The voltage must be 0 V DC. (u) On the P0076 connector, measure the voltage between the A (-) and B (+) pins. Result: 1 The voltage must be 28 ÃÂ± 2 V DC. (v) On the P0076 connector, measure the voltage between the A (-) and C (+) pins. Result: 1 For aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-21-0012, the voltage must be 28 ÃÂ± 2 V DC. 2 For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-21-0012, the voltage must be 0 V DC. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-803-A/500 CONFIG-1 21-51-00 Page 17 of 20 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL L. Follow-on (Figure 506)   (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 842-029-A (1) Remove the jumpers from electrical connectors P0076 and P0981. (2) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the PACK 1, PACK 2, and WING circuit breakers. (4) Connect electrical connectors P0075 to the LH pack valve, P0076 to the RH pack valve, and P0981 to the LH wing anti-icing valve. (5) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is a part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations (Section 6) of the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRB). (6) Install access panels 191KL and 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (7) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, close the PACK 1, PACK 2, and WING circuit breakers. (8) Disconnect the ramp interphone.
