			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 21-25-03-800-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. LINEAR ACTUATOR - ADJUSTMENT A. General (1) When the linear actuator is extended, the flap valve of the ram-air valve goes down (which permits the ram-air to flow to the cockpit and passenger cabin). (2) When the linear actuator is retracted, the flap valve of the ram-air valve goes up (which permits the ram-air to flow to make the heat exchanger of the pack cooler). B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL – 191EL (linear actuator of LH ram-air valve). – 191FR (linear actuator of RH ram-air valve). J. Adjustment of the Linear Actuator (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 820-002-A (1) Make sure that AOA sensors are in the down position. (2) Open the AIR/GND A, the AIR/GND B, the AIR/GND C, and the AIR/GND D circuit breakers, on the circuit breaker panel. (3) Make sure that the linear actuator (1) is in the extended position. (4) Disconnect the primary adjustment rod end (2) of the operation lever (3). (5) Manually move the operation lever to the extended position. (6) Put the operation lever on the primary adjustment rod end (2) and make sure that the bolt (4) goes through without any interference. NOTE: If there is some interference in step (5), adjust the primary adjustment rod end (2). (7) Loosen the operation lever (3) of the primary adjustment rod end (2). CAUTION:WHEN YOU ARE TO CLOSE THE AIR/GND A, B, C AND D CIRCUIT BREAKERS, THE TIME NECESSARY FOR YOU TO CLOSE ALL THE FOUR CIRCUIT BREAKERS MUST NOT BE MORE THAN 10 SECONDS (AMM SDS 32-63-00/1). (8) Close the AIR/GND A, the AIR/GND B, the AIR/GND C, and the AIR/GND D circuit breakers. (9) Make sure that the linear actuator (1) goes to the retracted position. (10) Manually move the operation lever (3) to the retracted position. (11) Put the operation lever (3) on the primary adjustment rod end (2) and make sure that the bolt (4) goes through without any interference. NOTE: If there is some interference in step (10) do the adjustment with the secondary adjustment screws (5). CAUTION: IF THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE TWO POSITIONS IS NOT CORRECT ON THEIR RELATED STOPS, DO A MIXED ADJUSTMENT OF THE PRIMARY ADJUSTMENT ROD END AND THE SECONDARY ADJUSTMENT SCREWS. (12) Install the bolt, the washers, and the nut to attach the primary adjustment rod end. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE LINEAR ACTUATOR MOTOR STOPS BEFORE IT GETS THE EXTENDED POSITION STOP. (13) Open the AIR/GND A, the AIR/GND B, the AIR/GND C, and the AIR/GND D circuit breakers. (14) Let the linear actuator extension occur.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: • MAKE SURE THAT THE LINEAR ACTUATOR MOTOR STOPS BEFORE IT GETS THE RETRACTED POSITION STOP. • WHEN YOU ARE TO CLOSE THE AIR/GND A, B, C AND D CIRCUIT BREAKERS, THE TIME NECESSARY FOR YOU TO CLOSE ALL THE FOUR CIRCUIT BREAKERS MUST NOT BE MORE THAN 10 SECONDS (AMM SDS 32-63-00/1). (15) Close the AIR/GND A, the AIR/GND B, the AIR/GND C, and the AIR/GND D circuit breakers. (16) Let the linear actuator retraction occur. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the external DC Power Supply to the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801- A/200). (2) Close the access panel, as applicable: – 191EL (linear actuator of LH ram-air valve). – 191FR (linear actuator of RH ram-air valve).
