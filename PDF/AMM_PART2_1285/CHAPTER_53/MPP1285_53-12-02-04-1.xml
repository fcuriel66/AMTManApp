			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN YOU DO TASKS WITH A HEATING GUN. IF YOU USE AN INCORRECT HEAT GUN NEAR FLAMMABLE MATERIAL OR FUEL VENT, EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR. (b) With a heat gun, apply hot air to the upper or lower support. Refer to Figure 402, sheet 2. (c) With a thermometer, control the temperature. Refer to Figure 402, sheet 2. NOTE: The temperature must not be higher than 70ÃÂ°C (158 ÃÂ°F). (d) Remove the bushings using the Bumper and Puller, which are contained in ITEM GSE 498 kit. Refer to Figure 402, sheet 3. (e) For the support made of AL 7050-T7451: NOTE: This step is not applicable for the support made of TI 6AL-4V. 1 Measure electrical conductivity, by the IACS method, around the hole of the support. NOTE: The value should be greater than 38% IACS value. Replace the support if the electrical conductivity measured is less than 38% IACS value. (f) If you find corrosion or wear in the internal side of the bushing, discard the bushing. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (4) With a cloth soaked in Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone (ASTM-D740), clean the housing surface. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 53-12-02 Page 4 of 15 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: • Make sure that at least 2.0 of the bolt thread remain. Refer to Figure 401 - sheet 2. • Install the shims (10) between the lower support (12) and the fuselage structure (7) in the same position marked, applying interface sealant PR1776M B-2. 1 Turn the nut (9) and measure the drag torque with a torque wrench. 2 Make sure that the drag torque measured is between 0.7 − 6.8 N.m (6.5 − 60.0 lb.in). 3 Add the measured drag torque value to the standard torque of 21.5 − 26.0 N.m (190 − 230 lb.in) to get the final torque. 4 Use a torque wrench to apply the final torque to the nuts (9). (3) For the installation of bushings: WARNING: LIQUID NITROGEN IS VERY COLD. CONTACT OF THE COLD GAS OR LIQUID WITH THE SKIN CAN CAUSE SEVERE BURNS. NITROGEN VAPORS CAN CAUSE QUICK SUFFOCATION BECAUSE OF THE DEFICIENCY OF OXYGEN. PROTECT THE CONTAINER AGAINST PHYSICAL DAMAGE. STORE IT AND USE IT IN VENTILATED ROOMS. DO NOT LET THE LIQUID TOUCH EYES, SKIN, OR CLOTHING. ALWAYS WEAR PROTECTION FOR THE SKIN, HANDS, AND EYES. (a) With the Guide (GSE 498), put the bushing in liquid nitrogen. Refer to step 1 of (Figure 403), sheet 1. (b) Let the bushing stay in liquid nitrogen for 15 minutes. WARNING: OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN YOU DO TASKS WITH A HEATING GUN. IF YOU USE AN INCORRECT HEAT GUN NEAR FLAMMABLE MATERIAL OR FUEL VENT, EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR. (c) With a heat gun, apply hot air to the upper or lower support. Refer to step 2 of (Figure 403), sheet 1. (d) With a thermometer, control the temperature. NOTE: The temperature must not be higher than 70ÃÂ°C (158 ÃÂ°F). WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SEALANTS. FOR DATA ON RISKS, PROTECTION, AND HANDLING OF MATERIAL, REFER TO MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET. (e) Apply sealant P/S 870C-12 around the housing. NOTE: The sealant cure time changes with the environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (f) Remove the bushing from the liquid nitrogen and install the bushing into the housing immediately. Refer to (Figure 403), sheets 1 and 2. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 53-12-02 Page 14 of 15 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
