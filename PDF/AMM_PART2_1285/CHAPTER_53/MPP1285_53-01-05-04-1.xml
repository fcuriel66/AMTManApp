Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT GSE 364 IS IN GOOD CONDITION. IT MUST BE USED IN BOTH SITUATION, WHETHER THE SEAT TRACK IS DRILLED OR NOT. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE SOLVENT GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (1) With a clean cloth soaked in rhodiasolve E-23, clean the seat track holes, seat tracks surface, cockpit floor structure holes, and the cockpit floor structure surface. (2) Do steps (a) through (y) when the installation of the new cockpit seat tracks POST- MOD. S.B.145-53-0027 part II is necessary. (Refer to (Figure 402): (a) Apply adhesive tape (10) to the lower side of the tracks, as shown in DET. D and DET. E. (b) Use a porous-point pen marker (11) to draw a alignment line (8) on the under and upper surface of the seat track (5) (RH side), as shown in DET. B and keep the mark. (c) Use a porous-point pen marker (11) to draw a alignment line on the cockpit floor structure which goes through the existing hole centers (RH and side), as shown in DET. A and DET. C. Keep the mark. (d) Position the new seat tracks on the floor structure, as shown in DET. A. (e) Install the screws (2), washers (3), and nuts (4) that attach the seat tracks (5) and (6) (RH and LH sides) to the cockpit floor structure. (f) Align the track (5) (RH side) with the centerline of the cockpit floor structure and use a C-clamp to attach the seat track (RH side) to the cockpit floor structure. (g) Install GSE 364 (1) to the first locking pin hole (7). (h) Use GSE 364 (1) to make sure that the locking pin engages correctly at each hole. (i) Use a C-clamp to attach the seat track (6) (LH side) to the cockpit floor structure. (j) Use GSE 364 (1) to make sure that the locking pin engages correctly at each hole. NOTE: If there is interference between locking pin holes and GSE 364 (1) or seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) to GSE 364 (1), remove the C- clamp (LH side) and go to step (f).

(p) Install the screws (2), washers (3), and nuts (4) that attach the seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) to the cockpit floor structure. (q) Install GSE 364 (1) in the first locking pin hole (7). (r) Use GSE 364 (1) to make sure that the locking pin is engages correctly at each hole. NOTE: If there is interference between locking pin holes and GSE 364 (1) or seat tracks (5) and (6) to GSE 364 (1), remove the screws (2), washers (3), and nuts (4) and remove the seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) and go to step (o).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (x) With a clean cloth soaked in rhodiasolve E-23, clean the seat track holes, seat tracks surface, cockpit floor-structure holes, and the cockpit floor-structure surface. (y) Apply alodine to the drilled holes according to CPM 51-21-04. (3) Position the seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) on the floor structure. Refer to (Figure 401). (4) Install GSE 364 (1) in the first locking pin hole (7). (5) Before you install the screw (2) and nut (4) to the assembly, measure the drag torque as follows: (a) Make sure the threads of the nut (4) and screw (2) fully engage. (b) With an applicable torque wrench, turn the screw (2) and measure the drag torque. Make sure that the torque value is 0.23 to 2.0 N.m (2 - 18 lb.in). NOTE: If you find that the nut is not in the correct range, you must replace it and do the drag torque check again. WARNING: CA-1000 CORROSION-INHIBITING COMPOUND IS TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. USE GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE GLOVES. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. OBEY THE MANUFACTURER’S HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. (6) Install the screw (2), washer (3), and nut (4) that attach the seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) to the cockpit floor structure. The screw must be wet with CA-1000. (7) Add the drag torque value measured in step (5) to the standard torque of 1.7 to 2.3 N.m (15 to 20 lb.in) to get the final torque. (8) Apply the final torque to the screw (2). (9) After 15 min. (which is the time necessary for unwanted sealant to extrude) apply the final torque to the screw (2) again. (10) Use GSE 364 (1) to make sure that the locking pin engages correctly at each hole. NOTE: If there is interference between locking pin holes and GSE 364 (1) or seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) to GSE 364 (1), remove the screws (2), washers (3), and nuts (4) and go to step (3). (11) Transfer GSE 364 (1) to the twelfth locking pin hole. NOTE: If there is interference between locking pin holes and GSE 364 (1) or seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) to GSE 364 (1), remove the screws (2), washers (3), and nuts (4) and go to step (3). (12) Remove GSE 364 (1). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 53-01-05 Page 9 of 10 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>
