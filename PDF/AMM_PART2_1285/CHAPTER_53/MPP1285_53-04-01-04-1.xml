(13) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing in the forward wing-to- fuselage attachment area. Use the applicable procedure as necessary: (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. NOTE: The sealant curing time changes with the environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (b) Acceleration of sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: The sealant curing time changes with the environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (c) Application of aluminum tape after tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as written in paragraph (b). 3 After sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape.
