			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: THE NACA-AIR-INTAKE POLYURETHANE FILM MUST BE FREE OF OIL, GREASE, AND RESIN. (1) To remove fingerprints, dirt, and minor contaminants: (a) Lightly rub the surface of the naca-air-intake with a soft cloth soaked in neutral detergent. (b) Clean the surface with water to remove the detergent from the naca-air-intake. (c) Dry the wet surface with a soft clean cloth or permit it to air-dry. (2) To remove oil, grease, or other heavy contaminants: (a) Lightly rub the surface of the naca-air-intake with a soft cloth soaked in Rhodiasolve E-23 or similar product. (b) Rub the area with a clean dry cloth before the solvent evaporation. J. Inspect (Visual Inspection) the Naca-Air-Intake Polyurethane Film SUBTASK 212-002-A (1) Visually inspect the naca-air-intake polyurethane film for erosion or small damages. (2) If a damage is found, do as follows: (a) Do a check to see if the aircraft structure is also damaged. If it is, refer to the applicable section of the SRM. If not, do the steps that follow: 1 Release the aircraft for up to 50 FC. 2 Before the fly-by period ends, remove the damaged polyurethane film (AMM TASK 53-04-02-000-801-A/400) and do a check to see if the aircraft structure is damaged. If it is, refer to the applicable section of the SRM. If not, install a new polyurethane film (AMM TASK 53-04-02-400-801-A/400).
