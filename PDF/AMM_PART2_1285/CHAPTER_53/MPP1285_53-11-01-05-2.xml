NOTE: Get access through the NLG bay to loosen the bolts. (3) Move the radome until the step between the radome and the fuselage skin at frame 1 is 0 thru ÃÂ± 1.0 mm (0 in thru ÃÂ± 0.040 in). (4) Torque the bolts that attach the supports to the aircraft to 2.82 - 3.4 N.m (25 - 30 lbf.in). (5) Apply sealing compound PR 1440 B2 to all contour of the supports and on the bolts. Refer to SRM 51-20-01. K. Gap Between Radome and Fuselage Skin at Frame 1 - Adjustment (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 820-009-B (1) Open the radome.
