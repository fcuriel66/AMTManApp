			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: WEAR RUBBER GLOVES AS A PROTECTION AGAINST CHEMICAL PRODUCT. (1) Prepare the wetting solution, whose composition is 2.5% neutral liquid detergent, 24.5% isopropyl alcohol, and 73% water. J. Application (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. CAUTION: THE RADOME SURFACE MUST BE FREE OF OIL, GREASE, AND RESIN. (1) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the radome surface. (2) Remove the burrs from the painted strip, as applicable. CAUTION: THE ADHESIVE SURFACES OF THE POLYURETHANE FILM MUST NOT BE JOINED TOGETHER. (3) Pull the liner slowly and circumferentially, and spray the adhesive side of the polyurethane film with wetting solution at the same time. Refer to (Figure 401); Step B). (4) Spray the radome surface with wetting solution. Refer to (Figure 401); Step A). (5) Correctly put the new polyurethane film in position on the radome. Refer to (Figure 401); Step C). CAUTION: START THE STEP BELOW AT THE CENTER OF THE RADOME NOSE AND WORK TOWARD THE REAR OF THE POLYURETHANE FILM. (6) Squeeze the water out of the boot with the acrylic spatula. Refer to (Figure 401); Step D). (7) If you see an air bubble, pull the polyurethane film backup off the part at the location of the air bubble, spray again with the wetting solution, and apply the film back. (8) NOTE: The wind pressure against the polyurethane films does not tend to lift the edges. One hour after the application of the polyurethane film, the radome is ready for service.
