			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 53-00-01-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ACFT MODEL(S) EMB-135 2. FUSELAGE DRAIN VALVES - INSPECTION A. General (1) The drain valves are installed in the fuselage pressurized areas along the fuselage lower skin, in the main door, and in the controls rigging door. (2) The main door and the controls rigging door are equipped with rubber drain valves. (3) Obey these instructions to do the inspection on the fuselage drain valves. B. Zones and Accesses Not Applicable C. Tools and Equipment ITEM DESCRIPTION PURPOSE QTY GSE 018 Tool, drain valve To remove/install the drain valve  D. Auxiliary Items Not Applicable E. Consumable Materials SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION QTY (BRAND) ASTM D740 Methyl-ethyl-ketone AR MIL-D-16791 Type I Neutral liquid detergent AR F. Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Outside, under the aircraft H. Preparation SUBTASK 841-011-B (1) The valve assemblies, installed along the skin of the fuselage pressurized areas, are made up of an ABS valve retainer that is attached to the inner surface of the fuselage wall and lined up with the hole in the wall. A valve housing is inserted (or removed) through this hole from the airplane exterior. (2) To remove fingerprints, dirt, and minor contaminants: (a) Lightly rub the surface of the fuselage drain valves with a soft cloth soaked in neutral detergent.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Clear the surface with water to remove the detergent from the fuselage drain valves. (c) Dry the wet surface with a soft clean cloth or let it air-dry. (3) To remove oil, grease, or other heavy contaminants: (a) Lightly rub the surface of the fuselage drain valves with a soft cloth soaked in methyl-ethyl-ketone (MEK). (b) Rub the area with a clean dry cloth before the solvent evaporation. I. Fuselage Drain Valves for Obstruction or Damage - Inspect (Detailed Inspection) (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 220-011-B CAUTION:DO NOT USE FORCE ON THE DRAIN VALVE DURING CLEANING AND INSTALLATION OPERATIONS BECAUSE A DAMAGED VALVE WILL CHANGE THE CABIN PRESSURIZATION. (1) There are no special maintenance requirements for the valve. The air flow effect across the piston seat of the valve housing and piston surface causes self-cleaning action. (2) Examine the fuselage drain valves (Figure 601). If gummed material or other sticky fluids/particles are collected in the valve, remove it with special tool GSE 018 and clean the components with usual cleaning agents and compressed air. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-011-B (1) Install the drain valve with special tool GSE 018, as necessary. (2) Apply the torque as shown in Figure 601, as necessary.
