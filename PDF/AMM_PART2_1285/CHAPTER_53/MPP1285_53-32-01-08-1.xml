(2) Make sure that the "GPU" pushbutton, on the overhead panel, is set at OFF. (3) Place a DO-NOT-SET-ON tag on the "GPU" pushbutton. (4) Make sure that the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches, on the overhead panel, are set at OFF. (5) Place DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tags on the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches. (6) Set the BACKUP pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to OFF. Make sure that the striped bar, on the pushbutton, comes on. (7) Place a DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tag on the BACKUP pushbutton. (8) Remove the APU cowling ( AMM TASK 49-11-00-000-801-A/400). (9) Disconnect the connectors of the electrical cables. (10) Loosen the APU starter-generator flexible duct. (11) Remove the clamp that connects the flexible duct to the starter/generator. J. Repair (Figure 801)  SUBTASK 300-002-A (1) Find the extension of the damage (1). (2) Make use of a porous-point pen marker (3) to mark the contour (4) of the damage (1) in the vibration reducer blanket (2) (Figure 801, sheet 1, DET. B). NOTE: Mark the contour (4) in a regular geometric shape to make easier the remaining process. CAUTION:CAREFULLY USE THE CUTTER TO PREVENT SCRATCHES IN THE FIREWALL SURFACE. (3) Make use of a cutter (5) to detach the aluminum foil (6) that covers the damaged vibration reducer blanket (Figure 801, sheet 1, DET. C). CAUTION:CAREFULLY REMOVE THE REMAINING VIBRATION REDUCER TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE FIREWALL SURFACE. (4) Make use of an acrylic spatula (7) to release the remaining vibration reducer (Figure 801, sheet 2, DET. D).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: With a plastic bottle with nozzle (8), spread MEK to help loosen the remaining bond, if necessary (Figure 801, sheet 2, DET. E). (5) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the firewall surface. NOTE: • Make sure that the surface of the APU firewall to be inspected is clean and without sealant residues, rubber, or oil. • Make a detailed inspection against scratches and other types of damage over the firewall surface. If there is damage, get in touch with the Embraer technical support personnel. (6) Fill in the gaps and voids around the damage border with sealant RTV 157 (Figure 801, sheet 2, DET. F). Refer to SRM 51-20-01. (7) If the area of the damage is larger than 4 square inches (25.08 square cm) and/or there are more than 6 damaged spots on the blanket: • Use the detached aluminum foil (6) as a template to mark a contour on the new vibration reducer blanket. • Use a pair of scissors to cut the new blanket in the marked area. • Release the protective backing of the cut-out blanket to install it. • With the spatula, squeeze the installed blanket to eliminate the bubbles. • Fill in the gaps and voids around the installed blanket border with sealant RTV 157 (Figure 801, sheet 2, DET. F). Refer to SRM 51-20-01. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the clamp to connect the flexible duct to the starter/generator. (2) Install the APU starter-generator flexible duct. (3) Connect the connectors of the electrical cables. (4) Install the APU cowling ( AMM TASK 49-11-00-400-801-A/400). (5) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tag from the BACKUP pushbutton. (6) Set the BACKUP pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to AUTO. (7) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tags from the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches. (8) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-ON tag from the "GPU" pushbutton. (9) Restore the aircraft to normal. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 53-32-01 Page 4 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>
