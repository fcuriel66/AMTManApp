			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (7) Install the clamp to connect the drain to the drain valve hose. (8) Install the splices (7) at the interface between the center and the rear wing-to-fuselage fairings (2). (9) Install the screws (8) that attach the splices (LH and RH side) (7) to the fairings. (10) Install the hydraulic compartment access panels (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100): – 193BL (LH side) (5). – 193CR (RH side) (1). (11) Install the 193AL access panel (6) (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (12) Install the 193LL access panel (3) (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (13) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing in the rear wing-to-fuselage attachment area. Use the applicable procedure as necessary. (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. NOTE: Sealant curing time will change according to the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR). (b) Acceleration of the sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: Sealant curing time will change according to the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR). (c) Application of aluminum tape after the tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as written in paragraph (b). 3 After the sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 150 hours. (d) Application of polyethylene film and aluminum tape.
