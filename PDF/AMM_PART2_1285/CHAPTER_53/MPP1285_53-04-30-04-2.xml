(15) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing in the rear wing-to-fuselage attachment area. Use the applicable procedure as necessary. (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. NOTE: Sealant curing time will change according to the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR). (b) Acceleration of the sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: Sealant curing time will change according to the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR). (c) Application of aluminum tape after tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as written in paragraph (b). 3 After the sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 CONFIG-2 53-04-30 Page 9 of 10 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
