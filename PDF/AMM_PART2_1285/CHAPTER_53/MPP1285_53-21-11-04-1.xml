			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task In the forward fuselage, on the RH side I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SEALANTS. FOR HAZARD, PROTECTION AND HANDLING OF MATERIAL, REFER TO ITS MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET. (1) Install the silicone rubber strips (1) in the bottom corners of the service-door frame shape. Bond them with sealant RTV 157 (4). Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 1; DET. B) NOTE: Make sure that the strips are correctly bonded to the frame after 1 hour. (2) To correctly adjust the doorsill sealing support (3) and the rubber seal (2). Refer to (Figure 401), Sheet 1; DET. B. (3) Install the rubber seal (2) from its bottom end in the doorsill sealing support (3). During the adjustment process, apply adhesive tapes (6) to hold the rubber seal in position. Attach the rubber seal (2) along all the service-door frame contour as far as the other bottom end. Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 2; DET. A). NOTE: • Make sure that the rubber seal end is correctly adjusted with the doorsill sealing support. If not, detach this end and adjust the rubber seal rearward. • Install the parts of the rubber seal in their correct position. Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 2). WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SEALANTS. FOR HAZARD, PROTECTION AND HANDLING OF MATERIAL, REFER TO ITS MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET. (4) Bond the rubber seal (2) on the main-door frame structure with sealant RTV 157. Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 2), for the approximate thickness of the sealant. (5) Lift the upper rubber seal (2) flange and use the cutter to cut off the areas of the lower rubber seal flange which interfere with these components: Doorsill sealing support, door stops, rotating arm supports, and frame roller supports. Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 3). NOTE: • Be sure to cut only the lower side of the rubber seal section. • Be careful to cut the lower rubber seal flange to prevent damage to the door frame. (6) Fill the gaps and voids between the two sides of the rubber seal and door frame with sealant RTV 157. Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 4). (7) In the upper part of the door frame, bond the flanges of the rubber seal with sealant RTV 157. Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 2; DET. B).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: • Wet the finger in a water-detergent solution and mold the sealant around the rubber boundary. • When the sealant is cured, the aircraft can be dispatched. • The sealant curing time changes with the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR). (8) Remove the adhesive tape (6). Refer to (Figure 401); Sheet 2; DET. A). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the service-door upper, forward, and aft corner trim shrouds (AMM TASK 25-23-07-400-801-A/400). (2) Pressurize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 21-31-00-860-801-A/200). (3) Make sure that there is no air leakage through the service-door contour. If leakage occurs, find its specific location. When the leakage is related to the service-door frame rubber seal, remove and install the rubber seal again in this region to remove the leakage. After this, do the functional test again. (4) Depressurize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 21-31-00-860-802-A/200). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 53-21-11 Page 10 of 10 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
