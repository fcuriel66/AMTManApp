			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Forward wing-to-fuselage fairing I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: WEAR RUBBER GLOVES TO PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST CHEMICAL PRODUCT. (1) Prepare the wetting solution, whose composition is 2.5% neutral liquid detergent, 24.5% isopropyl alcohol, and 73% water. J. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION: THE NACA AIR-INTAKE SURFACE MUST BE FREE OF OILS, GREASES, AND RESINS. (1) Clean the Naca Air-Intake surface with methyl-ethyl-ketone. (2) Install the masking tape. For polyurethane film installed at access panel 191GL, see DET. B. For polyurethane film installed at access panel 191EL or 191FR, see DET. C (Refer to AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Spray the Naca Air-Intake surface with wetting solution. CAUTION: THE ADHESIVE SURFACES OF THE POLYURETHANE FILM MUST NOT BE JOINED TOGETHER. (4) Start the removal of the liner protection from the small section (Refer to DET. D). (5) With the masking tape used as a reference, put the film on the Naca air-intake surface. Make a pressure with the spatula to move the wetting liquid out. Do it from the center to the edges of the polyurethane film to prevent air bubbles. (6) NOTE: The wind pressure against the polyurethane film will not tend to cause the edge lifting. One hour after the application of the polyurethane film, the Naca Air Intake is ready for service.
