Expandable Parts Not Applicable H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task In the forward fuselage I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Sand the seating area of the radome rubber seal (2) and clean it with methyl-ethyl- ketone. (2) Install the rubber seal (5) with adhesive (3). Do not permit the rubber seal to cover the latches (1) or reinforcing channels in frame 1 (6). (3) Apply sealant along all the contour of the radome edge, as shown in the (Figure 401). (4) Adjust the latches (1) to put an initial pressure on the rubber seal (5). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 53-11-02 Page 4 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (5) Make sure that the initial pressure got with the adjustment of the latches (1) is sufficient to seal the radome (4) against water penetration as follows: (a) Put a strap of sufficiently strong paper on frame 1 (6), in the seating area of the rubber seal (5), and close the radome (4). (b) Pull the paper strap, as if to move it. (c) Open the radome (4) and make sure that the latches (1) are not too much tightened and that the radome opens easily. NOTE: The resistance found to move the paper strap and to open the radome (4) will show the correct pressure to be got when the latches (1) are adjusted. (d) Refer to (Figure 401) and do a check of the gap values between the radome (4) and the fuselage frame (1). NOTE: If the skin interferes with the radome edge, a false stop occurs. If this occurs, rework the skin where it is necessary to adjust the gap to the values shown in (Figure 401). (e) Do a tightness test with water at a pressure above 2 psi (0.14 Kg/cm). NOTE: Make sure that the radome (4) is correctly sealed. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Touch up the painting where necessary. (2) Adjust the Radome according to AMM MPP 53-11-01/500.
