Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (1) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the surface. (2) Apply COR-BAN 27L to the faying surface of the lateral wing-to-fuselage fairing (3). (3) Install the lateral wing-to-fuselage fairings (2) (LH and RH sides). (4) Install the screws (1) that attach the lateral wing-to-fuselage fairing (2). Refer to (Figure 401); SECTION B-B and SECTION C-C. NOTE: For torque, refer to (AMM MPP 20-10-01/200). (5) Remove the protection cap from the disconnected electrical connector. (6) Connect the electrical connector to the emergency light (4) (LH and RH sides). (7) Install access panels (3) (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100): – 194AR (RH side). – 195AL (LH side). (8) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing in the lateral wing-to- fuselage attachment area. Use the applicable procedure as necessary: (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. NOTE: Sealant curing time will change according to the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Acceleration of sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: Sealant curing time will change according to the environmental conditions. Refer to (SRM 51-20-01-PR). (c) Application of aluminum tape after tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as written in paragraph (b). 3 After sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 150 hours. (d) Application of polyethylene film and aluminum tape. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Apply a polyethylene film over the sealant. 3 Apply the aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 10 days. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Do the operational check of the emergency light, according to AMM TASK 33-50-00-700-801-A/500. (2) Do the electrical-bonding test procedure as given in AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/ 200. Refer to (Figure 402).
