			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Operationally Check TAT Sensor Heating (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: • ISOLATE THE TEST AREA AND IDENTIFY IT TO PREVENT INJURY TO THE MAINTENANCE PERSONS. • DURING TEST, THESE ITEMS BECOME HOT AND AFTER THE AIRCRAFT LANDING THESE ITEMS ARE HOT:  - PITOT SENSORS.  - PITOT/STATIC SENSOR.  - ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORTS.  - TAT SENSORS.  - PRESSURIZATION STATIC PORTS.  - AOA SENSORS.  DO NOT TOUCH THEM SO AS NOT TO BURN YOURSELF. CAUTION: DO NOT STOP THIS TASK BEFORE IT IS COMPLETED, BECAUSE THIS CAN DECREASE THE SERVICE LIFE OF THESE COMPONENTS. (1) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0028, set the thrust lever to "Thrust Set" position. (2) Do the check as follows: (a) On the panel, set the BATT 1 switch to OFF and make sure that the BATT 2 switch is set to OFF. (b) Make sure that the ENGINE AIR INLET 1 and ENGINE AIR INLET 2 pushbuttons, on the overhead panel, are set to ON. Result: 1 On the ENGINE AIR INLET 1 and ENGINE AIR INLET 2 pushbuttons, the striped bars are off. (c) On the overhead panel, set SENSORS (PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, and PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2) pushbuttons to ON. Result: 1 On the SENSORS (PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, and PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2) pushbuttons, the striped bars are off. (d) On the overhead panel, set the OVERRIDE switch to ENG. (e) On the circuit breaker panel, open the N2 SIGNAL 1A circuit breaker. • N2 SIGNAL 1A (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/POWERPLANT/N2 SIGNAL/1A). Result: 1 The TAT sensor 1 becomes hot. (f) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0028, set the thrust lever to "IDLE" position. Result: 1 The TAT sensor 1 becomes cool. 2 Make sure that, On the EICAS display, the TAT 1 HEAT INOP caution message does not come into view. (g) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0028, set the thrust lever to "THRUST SET" position. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 30-33-00 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 The TAT sensor 1 becomes hot. (h) On the overhead panel, set the ENGINE AIR INLET 1 pushbutton to OFF. Result: 1 TAT sensor 1 becomes cool. 2 On the ENGINE AIR INLET 1 pushbutton, the striped bar comes on. (i) On the circuit breaker panel, open the N2 SIGNAL 2B circuit breaker. • N2 SIGNAL 2B (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/POWERPLANT/N2 SIGNAL/2B). Result: 1 TAT sensor 2 becomes hot. (j) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0028, set the thrust lever to "IDLE" position. Result: 1 The TAT sensor 2 becomes cool. 2 Make sure that, On the EICAS display, the TAT 2 HEAT INOP caution message does not come into view. (k) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0028, set the thrust lever to "THRUST SET" position. Result: 1 The TAT sensor 2 becomes hot. (l) On the overhead panel, set the ENGINE AIR INLET 2 pushbutton to OFF. Result: 1 TAT sensor 2 becomes cool. 2 On the ENGINE AIR INLET 2 pushbutton, the striped bar comes on. (m) Set the OVERRIDE switch to AUTO. (n) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the SENSORS HTG circuit breaker. • SENSORS HTG (Location Tip: DC BUS 2/ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION/ SENSORS HTG). Result: 1 TAT sensor 1 and TAT sensor 2 become hot. 2 The EICAS display shows the TAT 1-2 HEAT INOP caution messages. 3 The master CAUTION lights flash. (o) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. NOTE: Make sure that the AOA sensors are in the down position (AMM SDS 27-36-00/1). (p) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the AIR/GND A, B, C, and D circuit breakers below. • AIR/GND A (Location Tip: DC BUS 1/LDG GEAR/AIR/GND A).
