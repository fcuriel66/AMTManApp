(2) Remove the access panels that follow (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100), as applicable. – 191EL (leak thermostat of the LH half wing). – 191FR (leak thermostat of the RH half wing). (3) Open maintenance panel door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100) to get access to: – (PRE-MOD. S.B.145-45-0001) The CMC RESET/INHIBIT switch. – (POST-MOD. S.B.145-45-0001) The CMC RESET/ENABLE switch. (4) Make sure that these switches, on the Maintenance panel, are at the middle position: – (PRE-MOD. S.B.145-45-0001) CMC RESET/INHIBIT switch. – (POST-MOD. S.B.145-45-0001) CMC RESET/ENABLE switch. J. Operational Check of the Wing Leak Thermostat (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: BECAUSE OF THE HIGH TEMPERATURES, BE CAREFUL NOT TO BURN YOURSELF WHEN YOU HEAT THE LEAK THERMOSTAT. (1) Do the check as follows: (a) (POST-MOD. S.B.145-45-0001) Turn the CMC RESET/ENABLE switch, on the Maintenance panel, to the ENABLE position. (b) Slowly and continuously increase the temperature of the leak thermostat on the LH and RH half wing with a heat gun until it is higher than 93.3 ÃÂ°C (200 ÃÂ°F). NOTE: The leak thermostat temperature cannot be higher than 250 ÃÂ°C (482 ÃÂ°F). (c) Do a CMC downloading ( AMM TASK 45-45-00-970-802-A/200) and make sure that these messages come into view: Result: 1 WING 1 A/ICE LEAK and WING 2 A/ICE LEAK. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) (POST-MOD. S.B.145-45-0001) Turn the CMC RESET/ENABLE switch, on the Maintenance panel, to the middle position.
