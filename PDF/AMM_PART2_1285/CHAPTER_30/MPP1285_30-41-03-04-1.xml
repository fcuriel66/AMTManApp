			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Tighten the nut (8) with the necessary torque. (2) To install the arm, do as follows: (a) Make sure that the shaft of the motor/converter is in the external position. (b) Energize the aircraft with the External DC-Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (c) Put the splined bushing (6) in the mounting adapter (7) of the arm/blade assembly (1). NOTE: Align the slot of the splined bushing (6) with the slot of the mounting adapter (7). (d) With the arm/blade assembly (1) in the external position, put its mounting adapter (7) on the shaft, with the slot of the mounting adapter aligned with the output shaft line. If there is no line on the output shaft, put the drive arm as close to the external position as possible. (e) Tighten the screw (5). (f) Install the bolt (3). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-004-A CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE WINDSHIELD SURFACE IS WET WITH WATER AND KEEP IT WET DURING ALL THE PROCEDURE.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) On the circuit breaker panel, open the WIPER 1 or WIPER 2 circuit breaker to stop the arm/blade assembly (1) in the windshield inboard position. (d) If the arm/blade assembly (1) does not stop with the blade turned to the windshield inboard position (ideal position), do the steps below: 1 Remove the arm/blade assembly (1) ( AMM TASK 30-41-03-000-801-A/ 400). 2 Put the arm/blade assembly (1) on the shaft and make sure that the notches of the splined bushing (6) are away from the notches of the shaft. NOTE: Each notch of the splined bushing (6) shows a blade movement of 3 inches (75 mm), approximately, on the windshield surface. (e) Complete the installation of the arm/blade assembly (1) and do steps (2) and (3) again. (f) If the arm/blade assembly (1) does not stop with the blade turned to the windshield inboard position (ideal position) again, do the steps below: 1 Remove the arm/blade assembly (1) ( AMM TASK 30-41-03-000-801-A/ 400) again. 2 Remove the splined bushing (6) from the mounting adapter (7). 3 Put the splined bushing (6) in the mounting adapter (7) with its slot at 90 or 180 degrees from the original position, toward the error (refer to detail D). NOTE: • The rotation of 90 degrees of the splined bushing (6) from the initial position shows a blade movement of 0.7 inches (20 mm), approximately, on the windshield surface. • The rotation of 180 degrees of the splined bushing (6) from the initial position shows a blade movement of 1.4 inches (40 mm), approximately, on the windshield surface. (g) Torque the screw (5) as necessary. (h) Torque the bolt (3) as necessary. (i) Safety the bolt (3) with new lockwire (4). (j) Adjust the pressure of the arm/blade assembly against the windshield ( AMM TASK 30-41-03-700-801-A/500). (k) On the windshield wiper control panel, set switches 1 and 2 to OFF. (l) On the circuit breaker panel, close the WIPER 1 and WIPER 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them. (m) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
