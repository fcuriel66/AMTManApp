Operational Test of the Airfoil Anti-Icing System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE DUCTS OR COMPONENTS OF THE ANTI-ICING SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF. THE HIGH AIR TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. (1) Start the APU ( AMM TASK 49-10-00-910-802-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C11 or AMM TASK 49-13-00-910-802-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C14). (2) Set the APU switch to ON. (3) Set these push-button and knob as follows: • PACK 1 AND PACK 2 - ON. • X BLEED - OPEN. • APU BLEED - OPEN. • OVERRIDE - ALL. • WING - ON. • STAB - ON. CAUTION: • DO NOT HOLD THE ICE DETECTION/TEST SWITCH AT POSITION 1 OR 2 FOR MORE THAN 15 SECONDS. • DO NOT DO THIS TEST MORE THAN TWO TIMES TO PREVENT AN OVER-HEATING CONDITION AT THE WING AND EMPENNAGE LEADING EDGES. IF IT IS NECESSARY TO DO THE TEST AGAIN, STOP UNTIL THE LEADING EDGES GET THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AGAIN. (4) (PRE-MOD. S.B.145-30-0022) Do as follows: (a) Set the TEST switch, on the overhead panel, to 1 or 2 and hold it for 15 seconds. Make sure that the "OPEN" indication of the WING and STAB push- buttons comes on and the EICAS shows the following messages: • ICE CONDITION • ICE DET 1-2 FAIL • WG 1-2 A/ICE FAIL • STAB A/I FAIL • BLD 1-2 LOW TEMP EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 30-10-00 Page 3 of 10 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
