			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Forward Electronic Compartment I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-004-A (1) On the Overhead Circuit Breaker panel, on the cockpit ceiling, make sure that the SENSORS HTG circuit breaker is closed. • SENSORS HTG (Location tip: DC BUS 2/ICE AND RAIN PROTECTION/ SENSORS HTG). (2) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). CAUTION:BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU GET ACCESS TO FORWARD ELECTRONIC COMPARTMENT TO NOT LEAN ON THE PITOT LINE. DAMAGE TO THE ANEMOMETRIC SYSTEM CAN OCCUR. (3) Open the access door 113CZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). WARNING: • ISOLATE THE TEST AREA AND IDENTIFY IT TO PREVENT INJURY TO THE MAINTENANCE PERSONS. • DO NOT TOUCH THE ITEMS BELOW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AIRCRAFT LANDING OR DURING THE TEST, BECAUSE THE HIGH TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO YOU:  - PITOT SENSORS.  - PITOT/STATIC SENSOR.  - ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORTS.  - TAT SENSORS.  - PRESSURIZATION STATIC PORTS.  - AOA SENSORS. CAUTION: DO NOT STOP THIS TASK BEFORE IT IS COMPLETED, BECAUSE THIS CAN DECREASE THE SERVICE LIFE OF THESE COMPONENTS. (4) To energize the heater(s) do as follows (Figure 501): (a) On the overhead panel, set the BATT 1 switch to OFF and make sure that the BATT 2 switch is set to OFF. (b) Set the SENSORS (PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, and PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2) pushbuttons, on the overhead panel, to ON. (c) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the N2 SIGNAL 2A circuit breaker. NOTE: • Pitot sensors 1 and 2, and anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 become hot. • If the temperature of the pitot lines is less the 40ÃÂ°F (4.4ÃÂ°C) the pitot lines heater(s) will become hot.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • N2 SIGNAL 2A (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/POWERPLANT/N2 SIGNAL 2A). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the PITOT 1-2 INOP caution messages. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (d) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. J. Operational Test of Pitot Lines Heater SUBTASK 710-006-A EFFECTIVITY: ON ACFT PRE-MOD. S.B. 145-30-0056 (1) Remove the insulation blanket (1) from the tube. Refer to Figure 502. (2) If the temperature of the pitot line is less than 35.6ÃÂ°F (2ÃÂ°C), do as follows: NOTE: The thermostat (3) must be kept at this temperature until the test is completed. WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE HEATER(S) FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS. IF YOU TOUCH THE HEATER(S) FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS, IT WILL CAUSE INJURY TO YOU. (a) Use the infrared thermometer to check the increase of the temperature on the pitot line heater (2) or feeling the pitot line heater (2) to make sure it is warm. Refer to Figure 502. (3) If the temperature of the pitot line is more than 35.6ÃÂ°F (2ÃÂ°C), do as follows: (a) Release the pitot line heater (2) to gain access to the thermostat (3). Refer to Figure 502. NOTE: To release the pitot line heater (2) it is necessary to remove the tie-down strap. Refer to AMM MPP 30-31-03/400. CAUTION: PROTECT THE EXPOSED ELECTRONIC AGAINST WATER. (b) Decrease the temperature of the thermostat (3) to less than 35.6ÃÂ°F (2ÃÂ°C). Refer to Figure 502. NOTE: • You can use crushed ice or dry ice to decrease the temperature of the thermostat (3). • The thermostat (3) must be kept at this temperature until the test is completed. WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE HEATER(S) FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS. IF YOU TOUCH THE HEATER(S) FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS, IT WILL CAUSE INJURY TO YOU. (c) Use the infrared thermometer to check the increase of the temperature on the pitot line heater (2) or feeling the pitot line heater (2) to make sure it is warm. Refer to Figure 502.
