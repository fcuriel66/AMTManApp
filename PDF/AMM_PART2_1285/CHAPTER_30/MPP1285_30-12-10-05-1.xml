			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 30-12-10-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. HORIZONTAL-STABILIZER ANTI-ICING SYSTEM MONITORING TUBES - LEAKAGE/TEST A. General (1) The function of this test is to make sure that there is no leakage in the connections of the horizontal-stabilizer anti-icing system monitoring tubes. (2) This test is divided into two steps: (a) Step I: To make sure if there is leakage. (b) Step II: If leakage is found in step I, do this step to find the position of the leakage and make the necessary repairs. B.

Preparation (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE DUCTS OR COMPONENTS OF THE ANTI-ICING SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF, BECAUSE THE HIGH AIR TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. (1) On the CB Panel, open the STAB circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (2) Remove the horizontal-stabilizer tip ( AMM TASK 55-13-02-000-801-A/400) to get access to the horizontal-stabilizer anti-icing system hose. (3) Remove the lockwire and loosen the clamp that holds the hose to the piccolo tube. (4) Before you connect the leakage test box to the horizontal-stabilizer anti-icing system hose, do the procedure as follows to adjust the leakage test box (Figure 501): EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 30-12-10 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Make sure that there is no moisture and no foreign matter in the inlet filter of the leakage test box. (b) Install a hose to connect the air outlet coupling to the manometric pressure coupling on the LH side of the leakage test box. (c) Turn the pressure regulator knob fully counterclockwise (-). (d) Keep the pressure source selector in the CLOSE position. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESSURE REGULATOR KNOB OF THE TEST BOX (GSE 080) IS FULLY CLOSED IN THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE POSITION BEFORE YOU CONNECT THE SOURCE OF COMPRESSED AIR. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PROCEDURE DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (e) Connect a source of compressed air to the leakage test box. (f) Turn the pressure source selector to the AIR position. (g) Move the operation selector lever to the PRESSURE position and turn the pressure regulator knob clockwise (+) until you get an indication of 2 psi on the pressure gauge. (h) Turn the pressure source selector to the CLOSE position. (i) Disconnect the source of compressed air from the leakage test box. (j) Push the operation selector lever to the ESCAPE position until the pressure gauge shows zero. (5) Install the hoses (GSE 116) to the leakage test box and to the "T" connection (Figure 502). (6) Install the hose (GSE 115) to the "T" connection and the union. (7) Install the tube assembly to the union and to the horizontal-stabilizer anti-icing system hose. J. Leakage Test of the Horizontal-Stabilizer Anti-icing System Monitoring Tubes (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 790-002-A CAUTION:TOO MUCH PRESSURE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE HORIZONTAL- STABILIZER ANTI-ICING SYSTEM COMPONENTS. USE ONLY THE SPECIFIED PRESSURE VALUE (2 PSI) TO DO THE TEST. (1) Step I: (a) Connect the source of compressed air to the leakage test box. (b) On the leakage test box turn the pressure source selector to the AIR position. (c) Move the selector lever of the leakage test box to the PRESSURE position and turn the pressure regulator knob clockwise until you have a pressure of 2 psi.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (d) When the pressure becomes stable at 2 psi, release the leakage test box lever and turn the source selector to the CLOSE position. (e) After one minute (1 min.), read the leakage test box gauge to make sure the pressure decreased: 1 If it did: do step II. 2 If did not: move the leakage test box lever to the ESCAPE position until the pressure gauge shows zero, and go to the Follow-on procedures. (2) Step II: (a) Remove the horizontal-stabilizer leading edge 331 or 332 ( AMM TASK 55-15-00-000-801-A/400) to get access to the horizontal-stabilizer anti-icing system monitoring tubes. (b) On the leakage test box turn the pressure source selector to the AIR position. (c) Move the selector lever of the leakage test box to the PRESSURE position and turn the pressure regulator knob clockwise until you have the pressure of 2 psi. (d) When the pressure becomes stable at 2 psi, release the leakage test box lever and turn the source selector to the CLOSE position. (e) Use a brush to apply the leak detection fluid to the connections and examine them for leaks. (f) If there are leaks, find the related area(s). (g) Turn the selector of the leakage test box to the CLOSE position. (h) Move the leakage test box lever to the ESCAPE position until the pressure gauge shows zero. (i) If applicable, repair the wing anti-icing system components as necessary to remove the leak(s). (j) Do the test again and make sure that there are no leaks. (k) Install the horizontal-stabilizer leading edge 331 or 332 ( AMM TASK 55-15-00-400-801-A/400). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the tube assembly from the union and from the horizontal-stabilizer anti-icing system hose. (2) Connect the hose to the piccolo tube, with the clamp, and safety it. (3) Disconnect the hoses (GSE 115 and GSE 116) from the "T" connection, from the leakage test box, and from the union. (4) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the STAB circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from it.
