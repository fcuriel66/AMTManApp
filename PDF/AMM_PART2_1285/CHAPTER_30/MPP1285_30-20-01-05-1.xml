			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task LH/RH Engine I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Before you connect the leakage test box to the shroud port test of the interbulkhead assembly, do the procedure to adjust the leakage test box (Figure 501): (a) Make sure that there is no moisture and no foreign matter in the inlet filter of the leakage test box. (b) Install the cap of the LH side of the leakage test box to the outlet fitting in the Shop/Air Bottle Outlet. (c) Turn the pressure regulator knob fully counterclockwise (-). (d) Keep the source of compressed air closed. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESSURE REGULATOR KNOB OF THE TEST BOX (GSE 081) IS FULLY CLOSED IN THE COUNTERCLOCKWISE POSITION BEFORE YOU CONNECT THE SOURCE OF COMPRESSED AIR. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PROCEDURE DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (e) Connect a source of compressed air to Shop/Air Inlet in RH side of the leakage test box. (f) Move the operation selector lever to the PRESSURE position and turn the pressure regulator knob clockwise (+) until you get an indication of 50 psi on the pressure gauge. (g) Shut off the source of compressed air. (h) Disconnect the source of compressed air from the leakage test box. (i) Remove the cap of the LH side of the leakage test box. (j) Push the operation selector lever to the ESCAPE position until the pressure gauge shows zero. (2) Remove sealant P/S-870 B2 or P/S-870 BÃÂ½ (SRM 51-20-01). (3) Remove access panels 411AT and 421AT ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (4) Cut the lockwire to remove the shroud port test. (5) Remove the plug from the shroud port test. (6) Install hoses GSE 116 and GSE 115 to leakage test box GSE 081 (Figure 502). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 30-20-01 Page 3 of 6 Rev 52 - Apr 28/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (7) Connect the source of compressed air to the leakage test box (GSE 081). (8) Install connection MS24399D7 and hose GSE 116 to the shroud port test (Figure 501). J. Functionally Check Engine Thermal Anti-Ice (TAI) Interbulkhead Assembly for Leakage (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) To pressurize the shroud port test, move the selector lever of the leakage test box (GSE 081) to the PRESSURE position and turn the pressure regulator knob clockwise until you have a pressure of 50 psi. (2) When the pressure becomes stable at 50 psi, release the leakage test box lever to shut off the pressure supply. (3) After 5 minutes, read the leakage test box gauge to make sure the pressure is between 50 and 20 psi. NOTE: Five minutes after the source is shut off, the pressure must not be less than 20 psi. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Move the selector lever of the leakage test box (GSE 081) to the ESCAPE position. (2) Disconnect connection MS24399D7 from the shroud port test. (3) Disconnect hose GSE 116 from leakage test box GSE 081 and connection MS24399D7. (4) Disconnect hose GSE 115 from the leakage test box (GSE 081). (5) Install the plug to the shroud port test with a torque of 17.51 - 18.64 N.m (155-165 lbf.in). (6) Safety the plug to the shroud port test with the lockwire (MS20995C20). (7) Install access panels 411AT and 421AT ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (8) Apply sealant P/S-870 B2 or P/S-870 BÃÂ½ (SRM 51-20-01).
