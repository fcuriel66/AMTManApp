			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 30-41-04-400-802-A EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH REPELLENT COATING INSTALLED 5. NEXT GENERATION SURFACE SEALÃÂ® RAIN-REPELLENT COATING - INSTALLATION A. General (1) This task gives the procedure to apply the windshield rain-repellent coating. (2) This procedure is applicable to the LH and RH windshields. (3) The ambient temperature must be from 15ÃÂ°C to 30ÃÂ°C (60ÃÂ°F to 85ÃÂ°F), and humidity must be less than 45% relative humidity for maximum coating life. (4) The GSE 544 is the Rain-Repellent Coating (RRC) Master Kit (P/N: DSS1040).This GSE contains: • Reusable equipment, • Replenishment supplies (one DSS1027 Master Refill Kit) for approximately 10 windshields, and • Chemicals (two DSS1015 Application Kits) to coat 2 windshields. NOTE: • Refill kits DSS1015 and DSS1027 can be purchased to replenish the DSS1040 RRC Master Kit. • The DSS1015 Application Kit (Kit A) contains supplies and chemicals to coat 1 windshield. • The DSS1027 Master Kit Refill (kit D) contains replenishment supplies (consumables) to prepare approximately 10 windshields. • Alternatively, you can also get consumables and chemicals to perform a single application by purchasing a new Surface SealÃÂ® DSS 0100 kit.  Each DSS 0100 kit contains consumables and coating solution to coat one windshield (alternative to DSS1015 and DSS1027).  The DSS0100 kit does not need the heating blanket, but it can be used in conjunction with it when you want to comply with the cure time to increase the coating durability, or to extend the life-time until other refurbishing.  The DS0100 kit allows that a windshield can be coated or refurbished in one hour. • Embraer recommends that you do not mix the different chemicals and consumables between the DSS1015 and DSS0100 kits.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Make sure that the cockpit windshield electrical heat is off. (3) Make sure that the ambient temperature is between 15ÃÂ°C and 30ÃÂ°C (60ÃÂ°F and 85ÃÂ°F). (4) Monitor humidity. It must be less than 45% relative humidity for maximum coating life. (5) Put the workstand in position and get access to the cockpit windshield from the outside. (6) The windshield must not be too hot for you to touch, it and must be away from direct sunlight while you do the application procedure. J. Installation (Figure 403) (Figure 404)  SUBTASK 420-003-A WARNING: THE PREP AND COATING SOLUTIONS ARE TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. USE GOGGLES, DOUBLE VINYL GLOVES, AND RESPIRATOR WHEN YOU APPLY THE SOLUTIONS TO THE PAD. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. OBEY THE MANUFACTURER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. CAUTION: WHEN YOU USE THE PLASTIC CLEANING PAD, BE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REMOVED PARTICLES DO NOT GO INTO THE PAD AND BECOME A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF SCRATCHES IN THE COATING OR IN THE GLASS. (1) If the removal procedure was not done or if it is the first time that the repellent coating is applied, do as follows: (a) Use a soft cloth, a sponge or soft paper towel to wash the windshield with glass cleaner such as a 50/50 mixture of isopropanol and water, or a 50/50 solution of rubbing alcohol and water. NOTE: The Master Kit has none of the cleaning chemicals recommended for this procedure. Look for and obey the specified health and safety information on them. (b) Flush the surface thoroughly with clean water. (c) Rub the surface dry with strokes in one direction with the aid of a moist soft cloth, moist sponge, or soft paper towel. (d) Carefully use quarter-inch tape (2) from the Master Kit as a protection around the glass panel of the windshield. Refer to DET. B,(Figure 403). NOTE: This tape must cover the space between the windshield glass panel (3) and the edge of the seal (4). (e) Apply two-inch tape (1) to the windshield periphery. Partially overlap the quarter- inch tape (2) and cover the span moisture/hump seal. End at the windshield retainer or structure (5). Refer to DET. B, (Figure 403). NOTE: Make sure that the masking tape is fully pushed down to prevent contact of chemicals with the aircraft structure.
