Preparation (Figure 701)  SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Keep the aircraft grounded ( AMM TASK 20-40-02-910-801-A/200). (2) Remove access panel 191EL or 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE WING ANTI-ICE SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ENGINE OR APU STOPS, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH BLEED-AIR TEMPERATURE. THIS WILL HELP TO PREVENT INJURIES TO PERSON AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (3) Remove the damper (1). Refer to the AMM TASK 30-11-14-000-801-A/400 J. Cleaning of the Damper by Air Blast Method SUBTASK 170-002-A WARNING: USE EYE AND HAND PROTECTION WHEN YOU USE AN AIR SOURCE TO CLEAN. CONTAMINANTS CAN BECOME AIRBORNE AND CAUSE INJURY TO YOUR EYES AND HANDS. THIS WILL HELP TO PREVENT INJURIES TO PERSON AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. NOTE: THE COMPRESSED AIR MUST BE DRY AND CLEAN AS FOLLOWS: • THE COMPRESSED AIR MUST NOT CONTAIN WATER, OIL, OR RESIDUES OF OIL COMBUSTION. • AS AN ALTERNATIVE, CLEANING MATERIAL, USE ONLY A MATERIAL THAT IS APPROVED BY EMBRAER MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND APPLICABLE TO THE MATERIAL TO BE CLEANED. • TO REMOVE HEAVY CONTAMINANTS, BLOW AIR AT 25-PSI MAXIMUM PRESSURE FROM A REGULATED AIR SOURCE. (1) Apply pressurized dry air or nitrogen, in the two directions, into the interior of the damper. (2) Use a backlight to do a check for obstruction inside the damper. If necessary, replace it AMM MPP 30-11-14/400. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the damper (1).
