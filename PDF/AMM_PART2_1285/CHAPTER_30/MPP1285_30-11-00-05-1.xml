(9) Do the check of the pressure at the anti-icing valve outlet as follows: (a) Measure the pressure (pressure gauge installed at the manifold inside the wing- to-fuselage fairing) and write it. Result: 1 (PRE-MOD. S.B.145-30-0016 or PN 12949-2 installed) The pressure value must be 18 ÃÂ± 2 psig. 2 (POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0016 or PN 12949-3 installed and PRE-MOD.

(11) If the pressure is in the range specified above, continue the test. (12) Measure the pressure at the wing piccolo-tube tip (pressure gauge installed in the LH landing-light compartment) and write it. (13) The pressure in the wing piccolo-tube tip must be more than 5.6 psig. (14) If the pressure does not agree with the value in step 13, do a check for leakage in the connections, hose, and monitoring line ( AMM TASK 30-11-09-700-801-A/500). If the problem continues, change the piccolo tube (AMM TASK 30-11-07-000-801-A/400) and do the test again. (15) Set the APU BLEED switch to OFF. (16) Stop the APU ( AMM TASK 49-10-00-910-803-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C11 or AMM TASK 49-13-00-910-803-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C14).

(24) Set the XBLEED switch to OPEN. (25) Start the APU ( AMM TASK 49-10-00-910-802-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C11 or AMM TASK 49-13-00-910-802-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C14). (26) Set the APU BLEED switch to ON. CAUTION: DO NOT HOLD THE TEST SWITCH AT POSITION 1 OR 2 FOR MORE THAN 15 SECONDS. (27) Set the TEST switch to 1 or 2 and hold it for 15 seconds. (28) Do the check of the pressure at the anti-icing valve outlet as follows: (a) With the pressure gauge installed at the manifold inside the wing-to-fuselage fairing, measure the pressure and write it. Result: 1 (PRE-MOD. S.B.145-30-0016 or PN 12949-2 installed) The pressure value must be 18 ÃÂ± 2 psig. 2 (POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0016 or PN 12949-3 installed and PRE-MOD. S.B. 145-30-0021) The pressure value must be 19 ÃÂ± 2 psig. 3 (POST-MOD. S.B.145-30-0021 and PRE-MOD. S.B. 145-36-0028) The pressure value must be 18 ÃÂ± 1.5 psig. 4 (POST-MOD. S.B.145-36-0028) The pressure value must be 19.5 ÃÂ± 1.5 psig. (29) If the regulated pressure is not in the specified range, replace the RH wing anti-icing valve ( AMM TASK 30-11-01-000-801-A/400) and go to item (28). (30) Measure the pressure at the wing piccolo tube tip (pressure gauge installed in the RH landing light compartment) and write it. (31) The pressure in the piccolo tube tip must be more than 5.6 psig. (32) If the pressure does not agree with the value in step 31, do a check for leakage in the connections, hose, and monitoring line ( AMM TASK 30-11-09-700-801-A/500). If the problem continues, change the piccolo tube (AMM TASK 30-11-07-000-801-A/400) and do the test again.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (33) Set the APU BLEED switch to OFF. (34) Stop the APU ( AMM TASK 49-10-00-910-803-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C11 or AMM TASK 49-13-00-910-803-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C14). (35) Connect the electrical connector to the LH wing anti-icing valve. (36) Disconnect the pressure gauge from the test point of the manifold and install a plug to the manifold. (37) Disconnect the pressure gauge from the test point (in the RH landing compartment) and install a plug to the test point. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Install access panels 191EL and 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (2) Install the landing light covers ( AMM TASK 33-41-02-400-801-A/400).
