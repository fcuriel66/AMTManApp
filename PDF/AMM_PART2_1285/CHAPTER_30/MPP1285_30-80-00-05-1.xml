			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Test Procedures (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do the check as follows: CAUTION:DO NOT HOLD THE ICE DETECTION/TEST SWITCH AT 1 OR 2 POSITIONS FOR MORE THAN 10 SECONDS. (a) Set the ICE DETECTION/TEST switch, on the overhead panel, to 1 and hold it. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the ICE CONDITION advisory message and the ICE DET 1 FAIL caution message. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (b) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (c) Release the ICE DETECTION/TEST switch. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the ICE CONDITION advisory message and the ICE DET 1 FAIL caution message go out of view. (d) Set the ICE DETECTION/TEST switch, on the overhead panel, to 2 and hold it. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the ICE CONDITION advisory message and the ICE DET 2 FAIL caution message. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (e) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (f) Release the ICE DETECTION/TEST switch. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the ICE CONDITION advisory message and the ICE DET 2 FAIL caution message go out of view. (g) Open the ICE DETECTOR 1 circuit breaker, on the LH electrical-power control/ distribution box (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the ICE DET 1 FAIL caution message. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (h) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (i) Close the ICE DETECTOR 1 circuit breaker. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the ICE DET 1 FAIL caution message goes out of view.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 The EICAS display shows the ICE CONDITION advisory message and then it goes out of view. (j) Open the ICE DETECTOR 2 circuit breaker, on the RH electrical-power control/ distribution box (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the ICE DET 2 FAIL caution message. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (k) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (l) Close the ICE DETECTOR 2 circuit breaker. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the ICE DET 2 FAIL caution message goes out of view. 2 The EICAS display shows the ICE CONDITION advisory message and then it goes out of view. (m) Open the ICE DETECTOR 1 circuit breaker, on the LH electrical-power control/ distribution box, and open the ICE DETECTOR 2 circuit breaker, on the RH electrical-power control/distribution box (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the ICE DET 1-2 FAIL caution message. 2 The EICAS display shows the ICE DETECTORS FAIL caution. 3 The master CAUTION lights flash. (n) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (o) Close the ICE DETECTOR 1 and the ICE DETECTOR 2 circuit breakers (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1). Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the ICE DETECTORS FAIL and ICE DET 1-2 FAIL caution messages go out of view. 2 On the EICAS display, the ICE CONDITION advisory message comes into view and then goes out of view. • WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHILE YOU DO THE TEST ON THE ICE DETECTOR PROBES BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE THEIR INTERNAL HEATERS STARTED AS SOON AS A MASS ON THE PROBES IS SENSED. DO NOT TOUCH THE PROBE, EXCEPT AS INDICATED IN STEPS M AND N. • DO NOT TOUCH THE ICE DETECTOR PROBE FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS. IF YOU TOUCH THE PROBE FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS, IT WILL CAUSE INJURY TO YOU. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 30-80-00 Page 4 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: DO NOT USE TOOLS TO TOUCH THE ICE DETECTOR PROBES. IF YOU USE TOOLS, YOU CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE PROBES. (p) (For spray procedure) First apply Freeze Spray (2) to the ICE DETECTOR 1 probe, then spray water (3) (Figure 502). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows: • The ICE CONDITION advisory message. • (PRE-MOD. SB145-31-0054) The ICE COND - A/I INOP warning message. After approximately 60 seconds. 2 The two messages go out of view. (q) Push a master WARNING light. Result: 1 The master WARNING lights go off. (r) (For hand procedure) With bare fingers, firmly hold the ICE DETECTOR 1 probe, for approximately 3 seconds (Figure 502). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows: • The ICE CONDITION advisory message. • (PRE-MOD. SB145-31-0054) The ICE COND - A/I INOP warning message. After approximately 60 seconds. 2 The two messages go out of view. (s) Push a master WARNING light. Result: 1 The master WARNING lights go off. WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE ICE DETECTOR PROBE FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS. IF YOU TOUCH THE PROBE FOR MORE THAN 3 SECONDS, IT WILL CAUSE INJURY TO YOU.
