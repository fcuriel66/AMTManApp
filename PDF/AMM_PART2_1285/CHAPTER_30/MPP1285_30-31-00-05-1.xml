Operational Check of Pitot &amp; Anemometric Static Port Heating SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: • ISOLATE THE TEST AREA AND IDENTIFY IT TO PREVENT INJURY TO THE MAINTENANCE PERSONS. • DO NOT TOUCH THE ITEMS BELOW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AIRCRAFT LANDING OR DURING THE TEST, BECAUSE THE HIGH TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO YOU:  - PITOT SENSORS.  - PITOT/STATIC SENSOR.  - ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORTS.  - TAT SENSORS.  - PRESSURIZATION STATIC PORTS.  - AOA SENSORS. CAUTION: DO NOT STOP THIS TASK BEFORE IT IS COMPLETED, BECAUSE THIS CAN DECREASE THE SERVICE LIFE OF THESE COMPONENTS. (1) Do a check of the pitot and anemometric static port heating as follows (Figure 501): (a) On the overhead panel, set the BATT 1 switch to OFF and make sure that the BATT 2 switch is set to OFF. (b) Set the SENSORS (PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, and PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2) pushbuttons, on the overhead panel, to ON. (c) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, open the N2 SIGNAL 2A circuit breaker. • N2 SIGNAL 2A (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/POWERPLANT/N2 SIGNAL 2A). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the PITOT 1-2-3 INOP caution messages. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. 3 Pitot sensors 1 and 2, pitot/static sensor 3, and anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 become hot. (d) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (e) Close the N2 SIGNAL 2A circuit breaker. • N2 SIGNAL 2A (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/POWERPLANT/N2 SIGNAL 2A).

Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the PITOT 3 INOP caution message goes out of view. 2 Pitot/static sensor 3 becomes cool. (r) On the LH electrical-power control/distribution box, close the HEATING/PITOT 1 circuit breaker (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1). Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the PITOT 1 INOP caution message comes into view. 2 Pitot sensor 1 and anemometric static ports 1 and 4 become hot. 3 The master CAUTION lights flash. (s) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (t) On the RH electrical-power control/distribution box, close the HEATING/PITOT 2 circuit breaker (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the PITOT 1-2 INOP caution message comes into view. 2 Pitot sensor 2 and anemometric static ports 2 and 3 become hot. 3 The master CAUTION lights flash. (u) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (v) On the RH electrical-power control/distribution box, close the PITOT HTG 3 circuit breaker (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1). Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the PITOT 1-2-3 INOP caution message comes into view. 2 Pitot sensor 3 becomes hot. 3 The master CAUTION lights flash. (w) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (x) Close the N2 SIGNAL 2A circuit breaker. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the PITOT 1-2-3 INOP caution messages go out of view. 2 Pitot sensors 1 and 2, pitot/static sensor 3, and anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 become cool. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-004-A (1) Set the SENSORS (PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, and PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2) pushbuttons, on the overhead panel, to OFF. (2) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Close access door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (4) On the overhead circuit breaker panel, close the N2 SIGNAL 1B and 2A circuit breakers. • 1B (Location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/POWERPLANT/N2 SIGNAL 1B). • 2A (Location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/POWERPLANT/N2 SIGNAL 2A).
