			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Make sure that the WINDSHIELD 1 and WINDSHIELD 2 heating pushbuttons, on the overhead panel, are set at OFF. (4) Do the steps below to do a check to see if the external windshield heated area is cold: (a) Use a workstand (windshield) to get access to the work area. (b) With the windshield heating system OFF, wipe all the external windshield area with a lint-free wiper cloth moist with clean water or water the windshield area with clean water to reduce the temperature. NOTE: The windshields 1 and 2 become cold. (5) Energize the aircraft with the External DC-Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). J. Operationally Check Windshield Heating (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Simulate the W/S 1 (2) HEAT FAIL caution message as follows: (a) (POST-MOD S.B.145-30-0033) Set the WINDSHIELD 1 heating pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to ON. (b) Set the W/S HTG test switch, on the maintenance panel, to 1 and hold it. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the W/S 1 HEAT FAIL caution message. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (c) Release the W/S HTG test switch. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the W/S 1 HEAT FAIL caution message goes out of view. (d) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (e) (POST-MOD S.B.145-30-0033) Set the WINDSHIELD 1 heating pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to OFF. (f) (POST-MOD S.B.145-30-0033) Set the WINDSHIELD 2 heating pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to ON. (g) Set the W/S HTG test switch to 2 and hold it. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the W/S 2 HEAT FAIL caution message. 2 The master CAUTION lights flash. (h) Release the W/S HTG test switch. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the W/S 2 HEAT FAIL caution message goes out of view. (i) Push a master CAUTION light.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (j) (POST-MOD S.B.145-30-0033) Set the WINDSHIELD 2 heating pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to OFF. (2) Do the check of the windshield heating as follows: CAUTION: IF THE W/S HEAT FAIL CAUTION MESSAGE COMES INTO VIEW ON THE EICAS WHILE YOU DO THIS STEP, TURN OFF THE SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE WINDSHIELD. (a) Set the WINDSHIELD 1 heating pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to ON. Wait 5 minutes minimum to continue the test. NOTE: High ambient temperatures and sunlight rays interfere with the WHS operation Result: 1 The left windshield becomes hot. NOTE: Suggestions to do a check to see if the internal windshield area is hot: 1. Inside the cockpit, put one of your hands on the heated area and the other on the non heated area, so you can feel the difference between the temperatures. 2. Depending on the ambient temperature, inside the cockpit, visually you can see differences between he heated area and non-heated area. For example: fog only at the non-heated area, de-icing of the heated area, a clear heated area without ice, fog, and moisture when compare to the non-heated area. 3. You can use a infrared thermometer (laser digital thermometer) to monitor the temperature of the external windshield heat area. 2 On the WINDSHIELD 1 heating pushbutton, the striped bar goes off. (b) Set the WINDSHIELD 1 heating pushbutton to OFF. Result: 1 The left windshield becomes cool. 2 On the WINDSHIELD 1 heating pushbutton, the striped bar comes on. (c) Set the WINDSHIELD 2 heating pushbutton, on the overhead panel, to ON. Wait 5 minutes minimum to continue the test. NOTE: High ambient temperatures and sunlight rays interfere with the WHS operation EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 30-42-00 Page 4 of 11 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
