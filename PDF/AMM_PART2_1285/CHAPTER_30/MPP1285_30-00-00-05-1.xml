			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Set the thrust levers to the calculated % of N2 of to the (Table 502). NOTE: • The value of % of N2 can be within range of calculated of % of N2 (-0.2 / +0.4%). Refer to Table 502. • You can refer to Table 503 as an example. (2) If you found the value on the table: (a) Set the thrust levers to the value you found on (Figure 503), (Figure 504) and (Figure 505). NOTE: • The value of % of N2 can be within range of N2 (-0.2 / +0.4%). (3) OVERRIDE switch - ALL. • The OPEN inscriptions in the engine anti-icing pushbuttons will come on. CAUTION: • DO NOT HOLD THE ICE DETECTION/TEST SWITCH AT POSITIONS 1 OR 2 FOR MORE THAN 15 SECONDS. • DO NOT DO THIS TEST MORE THAN TWO TIMES TO PREVENT AN OVERHEATING CONDITION AT THE WING AND EMPENNAGE LEADING EDGES. IF IT IS NECESSARY TO DO THE TEST AGAIN, STOP UNTIL THE LEADING EDGES GET THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AGAIN. (4) Do the check as follows: (a) Set the TEST switch, on the overhead panel, to 1 and hold it for 15 seconds. Make sure that: Result: 1 The EICAS display shows these messages: • BLD 1 LOW TEMP (caution). • ICE DET 1 FAIL (caution). • ICE CONDITION (advisory). • CROSS BLEED OPEN (advisory) (This message will be shown for aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-36-0028 only). 2 The OPEN inscriptions in the anti-icing pushbuttons are on. (b) Push one of the master CAUTION lights. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (c) Release the TEST switch. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the messages go out of view. 2 The OPEN inscriptions in the wing and stab anti-icing pushbuttons go off.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Operationally Test Anti-Icing Valves (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-004-A (1) Set the thrust lever to IDLE position. (2) OVERRIDE switch - AUTO. CAUTION: • DO NOT HOLD THE ICE DETECTION/TEST SWITCH AT POSITIONS 1 OR 2 FOR MORE THAN 15 SECONDS. • DO NOT DO THIS TEST MORE THAN TWO TIMES TO PREVENT AN OVERHEATING CONDITION AT THE WING AND EMPENNAGE LEADING EDGES. IF IT IS NECESSARY TO DO THE TEST AGAIN, STOP UNTIL THE LEADING EDGES GET THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AGAIN. (3) Do the check as follows: (a) Set the TEST switch, on the overhead panel, to 1 and hold it for 5 (five) seconds. Make sure that: Result: 1 The EICAS display shows these messages: • ICE DET 1 FAIL (caution). • ICE CONDITION (advisory). 2 Make sure that: the OPEN inscriptions in the engine, wing and stab anti- icing pushbuttons flash. (b) Push one of the master CAUTION lights. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (c) Release the TEST switch. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the messages go out of view. 2 Make sure that: the OPEN inscriptions in the engine, wing and stab anti- icing pushbutton flashing stops. (d) Set the TEST switch, on the overhead panel, to 2 and hold it for 5 (five) seconds. Make sure that: Result: 1 The EICAS display shows these messages: • ICE DET 2 FAIL (caution). • ICE CONDITION (advisory). 2 Make sure that the OPEN inscriptions in the engine, wing and stab anti-icing pushbuttons flash.
