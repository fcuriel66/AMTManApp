			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Operationally Check Windshield Wiper (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-004-A NOTE: When HI or LOW is set, wait until the system becomes stable to check the number of strokes per minute or cycles. (1) Do the check as follows: CAUTION: BEFORE YOU DO THE OPERATIONAL TEST, MAKE THE WINDSHIELD SURFACE WET WITH WATER, AND KEEP IT WET DURING ALL THE TEST. (a) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 1 switch, on the overhead panel, to TIMER. Result: 1 The left windshield wiper operates for one cycle after a stopped-eight- second time delay. (b) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 1 switch to OFF. Result: 1 The left windshield wiper stops on the windshield mounting bracket. (c) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 1 switch to LOW. Result: 1 The left windshield wiper operates at 80 ÃÂ± 10 strokes per minute. (d) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 1 switch to HI. Result: 1 The left windshield wiper operates at 140 ÃÂ± 14 strokes per minute. NOTE: The speed changes from low to high while the movement does not stop on the glass. (e) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 1 switch to OFF. Result: 1 The left windshield wiper stops on the windshield mounting bracket. (f) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 2 switch, on the overhead panel, to TIMER. Result: 1 The right windshield wiper operates for one cycle after a stopped eight- second time delay. (g) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 2 switch to OFF. Result: 1 The right windshield wiper stops on the windshield mounting bracket. (h) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 2 switch to LOW. Result: 1 The right windshield wiper operates at 80 ÃÂ± 10 strokes per minute. (i) Set the WINDSHIELD WIPER 2 switch to HI.
