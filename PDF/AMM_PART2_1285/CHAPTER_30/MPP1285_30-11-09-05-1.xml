			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Leakage Test (Figure 502)   (Figure 504) (Figure 505) (Figure 506)  SUBTASK 790-002-A CAUTION:TOO MUCH PRESSURE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE WING ANTI-ICING SYSTEM COMPONENTS. USE ONLY THE SPECIFIED PRESSURE VALUE (2 PSI) TO DO THE TEST. (1) Step I: (a) Connect the source of compressed air to the leakage test box. (b) On the leakage test box, turn the pressure source selector to the AIR position. (c) Move the selector lever of the leakage test box to the PRESSURE position and turn the pressure regulator knob clockwise until you have a pressure of 2 psi. (d) When the pressure becomes stable at 2 psi, release the leakage test box lever and turn the source selector to the CLOSE position. (e) After one minute (1 min.), read the leakage test box gauge to make sure the pressure decreased: 1 If it did: do step II. 2 If it did not: move the leakage test box lever to the ESCAPE position until the pressure gauge shows zero, and go to the Follow-on procedures. (2) Step II: (a) Remove leading edge I 511 or 611 ( AMM TASK 57-41-00-000-801-A/400), leading edge II 512 or 612 ( AMM TASK 57-42-00-000-801-A/400), and leading edge III 513 or 613 ( AMM TASK 57-43-00-000-801-A/400) to get access to the wing anti-icing system monitoring tubes. (b) On the leakage test box, turn the pressure source selector to the AIR position. (c) Move the selector lever of the leakage test box to the PRESSURE position and turn the pressure regulator knob clockwise until you have the pressure of 2 psi. (d) When the pressure becomes stable at 2 psi, release the leakage test box lever and turn the source selector to the CLOSE position. (e) Use a sponge to apply the leak detection fluid to the connections and examine them for leaks. (f) If there are leaks, find the related area(s). (g) Turn the selector of the leakage test box to the CLOSE position. (h) Move the leakage test box lever to the ESCAPE position until the pressure gauge shows zero. (i) If applicable, repair the wing anti-icing system components as necessary to remove the leak(s). (j) Do the test again and make sure that there are no leaks.
