			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL IC-600 CONFIGURATION MODULE (IM-600) - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH IC-600 CONFIGURATION MODULE (IM-600) 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to download the configuration files into the IC-1 and IC-2 configuration modules (IM-600). B. The configuration module (IM-600) is an EEPROM that stores the IC-600 configuration data, instead of the hard-wired straps. The module gives an accessible memory area and a protected memory area. The protected area is only accessible by the manufacturer. The accessible area is programmed with a laptop computer connected to the existing RS-232 data bus for the IC-600. The check of the configuration module is only done by the IC-600 during on-ground power-up. C. The procedure to download the configuration files into the IM-600 of IC-1 and into the IM-600 of IC-2 is the same. The indications in parentheses are applicable to the IC-2 IM-600. D. Download the configuration files into the IM-600 by the time of installation or by the time when you apply an SB (Service Bulletin) that has effect on the IM-600 configuration. E. Get the configuration files for IM-600 from the Maintenance/Tech Support, accessible through the Internet (www.flyembraer.com), and put them in a group in a directory in a laptop. Each directory has a part number for each aircraft configuration. F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 31-42-02-860-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH IC-600 CONFIGURATION MODULE (IM-600) 2. IC-600 CONFIGURATION MODULE - DOWNLOADING A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to download the configuration files into the IC-1 and IC-2 configuration modules (IM-600). (2) For aircraft with EICAS versions before 17 and with IC-600 configuration module (IM-600), this procedure is not applicable. In this case, call Embraer Technical Support. (3) The procedure to download the configuration files into the IM-600 of IC-1 and into the IM-600 of IC-2 is the same. The indications in parentheses are applicable to the IC-2 IM-600. (4) Download the configuration files into the IM-600 by the time of installation or by the time when you apply an SB (Service Bulletin) that has effect on the IM-600 configuration. (5) Run the executable file (FLST.EXE) from the same directory as that into which it is downloaded from the Maintenance/Tech Support. NOTE: Some FLST versions can present problems when it runs in computers with dual core microprocessors. If this occurs, try to disable one of the processors through the computer BIOS configuration. Refer to the computer documentation. B.

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Cockpit I. Preparation (Figure 201)  (Figure 202)  SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Download the configuration file from the Maintenance/Tech Support through the Internet, into a directory in the laptop as follows: CAUTION: IF YOU DOWNLOAD INTO THE IM-600 AN INCORRECT FILE, THE IM-600 CONFIGURATION WILL NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE AIRCRAFT. (a) Refer to the IM-600 Files Specifications Table in the IPC - "ADDITIONAL CROSS-REFERENCE SECTION", to identify the correct part number of the configuration file according to the aircraft serial number. (b) Access the FLYEMBRAER through the Internet (www.flyembraer.com). (c) With your Username and Password, log in the FLYEMBRAER. NOTE: If you cannot have access to the FLYEMBRAER or to the Maintenance/ Tech Support, call Embraer Technical Support. (d) Click on the "Tech Support" tab, in the Maintenance icon. (e) Click on the "IM600 - Configuration files" option. (f) In the next window, a page with the aircraft type will come into view. (g) Click on the correct aircraft type and on the file part number. (h) When the window for the downloading comes into view, select a directory to save the file. (i) When the downloading to the laptop is completed, make sure that a ZIP file named with the part number is in the selected directory. NOTE: The file name has a ZIP extension (XXX-XXXXX-XXX.ZIP). This is a compressed file with all the necessary files to download the IM-600 configuration file from the laptop to the IM-600. (j) Expand the compressed file with the aid of a software compatible with ZIP files. A directory will be created automatically, with the same file part number.
