			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Remove the data disk from the aircraft ( AMM TASK 31-33-01-000-801-A/400). (2) Turn the computer on and put the data disk (which contains the flight data) into the magnetic optical drive. J. Recorded Data Disk Reading SUBTASK 070-002-A (1) The EQAR records flight data in two files, one with the ARINC-717 data and the other with the ARINC-429 data (if available). The ARINC-717 data is contained on the disk in a file folder named DATA, while the ARINC-429 data is contained on a file folder named A429. Each time the EQAR is powered up, a new flight file is created in the folder. The file is named by the TIME (month, day, hour, minute, second) when it was created. ARINC-717 and ARINC-429 recordings from the same span of time will have corresponding file names; for example, 09122127.d01 is ARINC-717 file, while 09122127.a01 is the corresponding ARINC-429 file. Note that the "file name" time is got from the EQAR internal clock, which does not necessarily correspond to the aircraft GMT clock time. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) If the disk is full, clear the data disk to record a new flight data. (2) Install the data disk in the EQAR ( AMM TASK 31-33-01-400-801-A/400).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Configuration Uploading SUBTASK 470-002-A (1) Go to the rear electronic compartment. (2) On the EQAR, open the front door and remove the recorded data disk from the disk drive, if installed ( AMM TASK 31-33-01-000-801-A/400). (3) Make sure that the ON LED ( green LED) and the STATUS LED (red LED) are on. (4) On the circuit breaker panel, open the QAR circuit breaker and, after a few seconds, close it again. (5) Make sure that the ON LED and STATUS LED are lighted. NOTE: See the label attached at the back side of the EQAR door for instructions in how to put the disk into the drive. If the disk is not in the correct position and alignment, the disk interlock will prevent full insertion. DO NOT FORCE IT. (6) Open the EQAR front door and insert the configuration UPLOAD disk. Do not close the door. NOTE: If it is necessary to configure the ARINC-429 parameters refer to EQAR User Guide.  (7) Wait for the automatic ejection of the UPLOAD disk. (8) Remove the UPLOAD disk. NOTE: Once the upload is completed, the power must be cycled for the EQAR to set up the new configuration data. (9) On the circuit breaker panel, cycle (open and close) the QAR circuit breaker. (10) Install the data disk in the EQAR ( AMM TASK 31-33-01-400-801-A/400). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-803-A/200 31-33-01 Page 5 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
