			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task On the cockpit ceiling - LH side I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Clean the hinge area (24) where the jumper terminal (26) is to be installed, as follows: (a) With a clean cloth soaked in Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), clean the area (24) where the jumper terminal (26) is to be installed. Before the MEK evaporates, wipe that area with a clean, dry cloth. (b) With a 400-grit sandpaper, remove the old Alodine from that area (24), then do step (a) again. NOTE: Do not touch the clean surface. (c) With a soft-bristled brush, apply Alodine 1200S solution to the area where the jumper terminal is to be installed (24), and let the surface stay wet for two to three minutes. The surface (24) will become yellowish. NOTE: The Alodine 1200S solution has a pot life of 24 hours. Use a new Alodine solution if it was not prepared in the last 24 hours. (d) With a clean cloth soaked in water, wipe the alodized area (24) at least three times, be careful not to cause damage to the Alodine film. (e) Let the surface (24) to air-dry. (f) With a clean cloth soaked in Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), clean the steel washer (27), aluminium washer (25), lock washer (28) and the jumper terminal (26). Before the MEK evaporates, wipe the terminal with a clean, dry cloth. NOTE: Do not touch the clean surfaces. (2) Install the circuit breaker panel (1). To do this, use the six screws (11) and washers (12) on the hinge (23). NOTE: The middle screw on the hinge (23) is used to attach the jumper terminal (26). Put the aluminium washer (25), jumper terminal (26), steel washer (27) and lock washer (28) on the middle hole of the hinge (23), before you install the screw (29). (3) Apply a thin coat of Fluid-Resistant Nylon NYCOTE 7-11-DARK BLUE Varnish on the middle screw (29) that attaches the jumper terminal (26) to the panel hinge (23). NOTE: For more information about the varnish, refer to ( AMM MPP 20-30-05/200). (4) Install the two screws (4), washers (5) and spacers (6) that attach the two cords (3). CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE CORRECT ELECTRICAL CABLES ARE INSTALLED AND THE CORRECT TORQUE VALUE IS APPLIED. INCORRECT INSTALLATION WILL CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT.
