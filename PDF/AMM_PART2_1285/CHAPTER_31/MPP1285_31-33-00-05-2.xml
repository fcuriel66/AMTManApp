			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-006-B (1) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that the QAR circuit breaker is closed. J. EQAR - Operational Test Procedures (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-006-B (1) Open door 272DR to get access to the rear electronic compartment. (2) NOTE: If the STATUS LED is off, open the EQAR front door and push the EJECT pushbutton to eject the optical disk. The STATUS LED will come on. On the EQAR front panel, make sure that the ON LED (green LED) and the STATUS LED are on. (3) Open the EQAR front door and insert an optical disk. (4) NOTE: Fault conditions can cause the STATUS LED to stay on. These incorrect conditions can cause the STATUS LED to come on: 1. No disk inserted 2. Disk not formatted 3. Disk write protected 4. Corrupted disk 5. Full disk 6. Overheating 7. Internal buffer overflow 8. Internal battery low voltage detection 9. Disk drive defect 10. Fault detection Make sure that the STATUS LED goes off after a few seconds. (5) For the test of the Full Disk function, do as follows: NOTE: The DISK LOW LED comes on when the disk is more than 70% full. (a) Insert a full disk into the drive. Result: 1 After a few seconds, the STATUS LED must be off and the DISK LOW LED must be on. (b) On the front face of the disk drive, push the EJECT button and wait for the optical disk ejection. Result: 1 The DISK LOW LED must be off and the STATUS LED must be on. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 CONFIG-2 31-33-00 Page 3 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
