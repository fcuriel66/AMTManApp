			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-004-A (1) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Put up the hydraulic platform (GSE 036) at the necessary height. (3) Open access door 272DR AMM MPP 06-41-01/100. (4) Open the AFDAMU front-panel door (6). Refer to (Figure 201). J. Upload AFDAMU Configuration Files SUBTASK 860-003-A CAUTION: CAREFULLY PUT THE PCMCIA CARD INTO THE AFDAMU. DO NOT USE FORCE AGAINST THE PCMCIA CONNECTOR. MAKE SURE THAT YOU PUT THE PCMCIA CARD IN THE CORRECT POSITION. (1) Make sure that the card is in the correct position before installation. Put the PCMCIA card (2) with the configuration file into the AFDAMU (1). (2) The green PCMCIA operation LED (5) will blink during approximately 5 seconds to show that the AFDAMU (1) loads the data frame. When the green LED (5) blinking stops and the LED stays on continuously, push the eject button (3) and remove the AFDAMU configuration card (2). If the amber LED (5) stays on during the data frame loading, it means that there is a software error in the PCMCIA card (2). If this occurs, push the eject button (3) to remove the PCMCIA card (2), configure the PCMCIA card (2) again with a valid data frame ( AMM TASK 31-31-07-860-802-A/200), and do the steps above again. (3) Put an empty PCMCIA card (2) into the AFDAMU (1). This card will record the flight data based on the configuration programmed with the first card. NOTE: With the empty card connected, the two PCMCIA operation LEDs will stay off. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-004-A (1) Close the AFDAMU front-panel door (6). (2) Close access door 272DR AMM MPP 06-41-01/100. (3) Remove the hydraulic platform (GSE 036). (4) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Open access door 272DR AMM MPP 06-41-01/100. (4) Open the AFDAMU front-panel door (6). Refer to (Figure 201). J. Recorded Data Reading SUBTASK 900-003-A (1) Remove the PCMCIA card (2) with the data from the AFDAMU (1). To do this, push the eject button (3) and remove the PCMCIA card (2). If you want to continue the recording with the same data frame, put other empty PCMCIA card. If you want to load a new data frame, refer to AMM TASK 31-31-07-860-802-A/200 to create a new data frame and upload it to the AFDAMU ( AMM TASK 31-31-07-860-803-A/200). NOTE: • When you insert the PCMCIA card to the AFDAMU card slot, the green color operation LED (5) blinks at a frequency of 1 Hz approximately, as a manner to recognize the card. • If the PCMCIA card is not full, and the recording logic is not satisfied, the green color operation LED (5) will blink six times and then will turn off. If the recording logic is satisfied, the green color operation LED (5) will continue blinking. • If the PCMCIA card is not correctly formatted, the amber color operation LED (5) comes on. (2) Put the PCMCIA card (2) with the data from the AFDAMU (1) in a personal computer with PCMCIA interface. ADRAS or ROSE or AGS (Station, Ground Analysis) software can be used to extract, convert, and display digital flight data stored in the AFDAMU. NOTE: • ADRAS and ADRAS-related support must be ordered directly from Honeywell. • ROSE and ROSE-related support must be ordered directly from L3. • AGS and AGS-related support must be ordered directly from SAGEM. • ADRAS, ROSE, and AGS are the software solution suggested by EMBRAER, but you can use other software to analyze downloaded AFDAMU data. EMBRAER has no responsibility for the parameter conversion settings if other software is used. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-005-A (1) Close the AFDAMU front-panel door (6). (2) Close access door 272DR AMM MPP 06-41-01/100. (3) Remove the hydraulic platform (GSE 036). (4) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
