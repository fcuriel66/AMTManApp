			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Carefully put the PCMCIA memory card (2) into the PCMCIA connector (4), with the up side of the memory card turned to the AFDAMU handle. (2) When you put the PCMCIA memory card (2) in the AFDAMU (1), three conditions can occur with the PCMCIA operation LEDs (5), as follows: 1. If the two PCMCIA operation LEDs (5) stay off, it is as sign that the PCMCIA memory card (2) is empty. 2. If the green PCMCIA operation LED (5) blinks during approximately 5 seconds, it is a sign that the AFDAMU (1) loads the data frame. After that, the green LED (5) blinking stops and the LED stays on continuously: the PCMCIA memory card (2) can then be removed. 3. If the amber LED (5) stays on during the data frame loading, it is a sign that there is a software error in the PCMCIA card (2). If this occurs, push the eject button (3) to remove the PCMCIA card (2), configure it again with a valid data frame ( AMM TASK 31-31-07-860-802-A/200), and do the memory card installation steps again. (3) Close the AFDAMU front panel door (6). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-004-A (1) Close access door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (2) Remove the hydraulic platform (GSE 036).
