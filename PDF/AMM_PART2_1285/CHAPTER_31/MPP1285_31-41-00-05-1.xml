			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Operationally Check DAU Channel Reversion Function (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A NOTE: When you open/close a circuit breaker, or push in/out pushbuttons, messages not related with this task can come into view/go out of view on the EICAS display. Ignore them. (1) Do the DAU Channel Reversion operational test as follows: (a) On the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, make sure that the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches are in the AUTO position. (b) On the reversionary panels, on the main instrument panel, make sure that the MFD rotary knob is in the NORM position. (c) On the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, set the BACKUP pushbutton to OFF. Result: 1 On the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, the striped bar on the BACKUP pushbutton comes on. 2 On the EICAS display, the BKUP BATT OFF BUS caution message comes into view and flashes. 3 The master caution lighted pushbutton, on the pilot's and copilot's sides, comes on and a bell discrete tone will be heard. (d) Push one master caution lighted pushbutton. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the BKUP BATT OFF BUS caution message flashing stops. 2 The master caution lighted pushbutton goes off and the bell discrete tone stops. (e) On the circuit breaker panel, open the DAU 1A circuit breaker (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/EICAS/DAU 1A) and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. Result: 1 The DAU 1A FAIL caution message comes into view and flashes on the EICAS display. 2 The engine 1 indications goes out of view and the EICAS display shows only the engine 2 indications. 3 The master caution lighted pushbutton, on the copilot's side, comes on and a bell discrete tone will be heard. (f) Push the pilot's or copilot's caution lighted pushbutton. Result: 1 The master caution lighted pushbutton goes off and the bell discrete tone stops. (g) On the EICAS reversion panel, on the control pedestal, push the DAU 1 pushbutton. Result: 1 On the EICAS reversion panel, the striped bar on the DAU 1 pushbutton comes on.
