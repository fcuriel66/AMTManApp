			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 31-31-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: AIRCRAFT WITHOUT AFDAU/AFDAMU 2. FLIGHT DATA RECORDER - FUNCTIONAL TEST A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the functional test of the Flight Data Recorder. In this test, the parameters are measured with the engines off and with the engines in operation. (2) This functional test gives the procedures for the check of all the inputs to the Flight Data Recorder system. WARNING: BEFORE PERFORMING A SPECIFIC STEP MAKE SURE THE REQUIRED PREPARATION ACTION(S) FOR THIS STEP IS (ARE) DONE. (3) As necessary it is possible to do the tests out of sequence and each test independently. (4) GSEs 058, 059, 070, and 196 will be used only on aircraft with the RVDTs/RVITs installed. The RVDTs/RVITs are used to monitor the control surface positions. (5) The combination of DAU and ICs P/Ns that make up each EICAS version is shown in a table referred to in IPC 31-41-01. (6) The GSE 092 - Hand-Held Download Unit (HHDLU), GSE 582 - Extended Hand-Held Download Unit (EHHDLU) for handheld and GSE 583 - Extended Handheld Download Unit (EHHDLU) for personal computer are applicable only to aircraft with FDR Honeywell installed. (7) GSE 091, GSE 490 or GSE 607 can be used to extract, convert, and display digital flight data stored on the Honeywell Solid-State Flight Data Recorder. (8) (Aircraft with FDR Honeywell installed) ADRAS and ADRAS-related support must be ordered directly from Honeywell. ADRAS is the software solution suggested by EMBRAER, but you can use other software to analyze downloaded FDR data. EMBRAER has no responsibility for the parameter conversion settings if other software is used. (9) The GSE 464 - Portable Interface Unit (PIU) is applicable only to aircraft with FDR L3 installed. (10) (Aircraft with FDR L3 installed) When using the L3 PIU (Portable Interface Unit) GSE 464, it is not possible to read binary values. To check discrete parameters, it is necessary to convert the binary value into its respective octal values. All possible combinations can be checked at Figure 510, Binary-to-Octal Conversion Table. NOTE: The Figure 510, Binary-to-Octal Conversion Table shows the conversion from binary to octal representation. The 12-bit word size can be divided into four octal representations (Octal 1, Octal 2, Octal 3, and Octal 4). To get the octal value do the steps that follow: 1. Set the indicated bit position to "1" or "0", in the 12-bit word. Refer to parameter indication specification. The other bits can be "1" or "0". Ignore them because they have no relation with the referred test, 2. In the corresponding line of the octal value column, get the octal digits of that binary representation, EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 31-31-00 Page 2 of 264 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 3. Remember that from a 12-bit word size, you will get four octal digits. E.g. Suppose that 11th, 10th, 9th, 7th, 6th, 5th, 4th, and 2nd bits are set to "1". Refer to Figure 511, Example of Conversion. The octal number will be: Octal 4 : 3 (if 12th bit = "0") or 7 (if 12th bit = "1"), Octal 3 : 5 (if 8th bit = "0") or 7 (if 8th bit = "1"), Octal 2 : 7, Octal 1 : 2 (if 3rd bit and 1st bit = "0") or 3 (if 3rd bit = "0" and 1st bit = "1") or 6 (if 3rd bit = "1" and 1st bit = "0"), or 7 (if 3rd bit and 1st bit = "1"). If 11th, 10th, 9th, 7th, 6th, 5th, 4th, and 2nd bits are set to "1" and the other bits are set to "0" the octal value will be 3572. (11) (Aircraft with FDR L3 installed) Process the aircraft flight data with the ROSE for Windows (GSE 473) or other similar FDR raw data analyzer software. NOTE: ROSE for Windows is the software solution suggested by EMBRAER, but you can use other software to analyze downloaded FDR data. EMBRAER has no responsibility for the parameter conversion settings if other software is used. B.

For this procedure, it is necessary to have an Automated Test Unit (ATU) or an IBM-compatible personal computer with Microsoft Windows 3.1 and PCMCIA driver, and ADRAS for Windows to process the aircraft flight data. Get the EMB-145 Parameter Conversion Database, necessary for the ADRAS, from EMBRAER - Customer Support Division. • If you need the data stored in the FDR for a different purpose, do a downloading of the stored data before you do the next steps. That is because you can overwrite the data stored in the FDR. • During the downloading process, the FDR do not record data. (54) (On-aircraft test) Do the on-aircraft test of the parameters with the engines in operation, at the same time as they are recorded in the FDR.

(2) The functional test is divided into two parts: • The first part is accomplished with the airplane on the ground and consists of testing in real time the parameters that belong to the FDRS or that may not be activated during a normal flight. • The second part consists in analyzing the retrieved data from the FDRS. NOTE: On the second part the test, it is described how to analyze data retrieved from the FDRS after a normal flight and how to interpret the engineering values of each parameter. Through this procedure, it is possible to functionally check the FDRS parameters from a personal computer (PC), thus reducing the airplane downtime. (3) GSEs 058, 059, 070, and 196 will be used only on aircraft with the RVDTs/RVITs installed. The RVDTs/RVITs are used to monitor the control surface positions. (4) The combination of DAU and ICs P/Ns that make up each EICAS version is shown in a table referred to in IPC 31-41-01. (5) GSE 091, GSE 490 or GSE 607 can be used to extract, convert, and display digital flight data stored on the Honeywell Solid-State Flight Data Recorder. (6) (Aircraft with Honeywell FDR installed) ADRAS and ADRAS-related support must be ordered directly from Honeywell. ADRAS is the software solution suggested by EMBRAER, but you can use other software to analyze downloaded FDR data. EMBRAER has no responsibility for the parameter conversion settings if other software is used. The parameters mnemonics contained in this task are the same used in ADRAS database, and may be not be the same for other software. (7) (Aircraft with Honeywell FDR installed) The GSE 092 or GSE 582 or GSE 583 can be used to perform the task. (8) (Aircraft with FDR L3 installed) Process the aircraft flight data with the ROSE for Windows (GSE 473) or other similar FDR raw data analyzer software. NOTE: ROSE for Windows is the software solution suggested by EMBRAER, but you can use other software to analyze downloaded FDR data. EMBRAER has no responsibility for the parameter conversion settings if other software is used. (9) Flight Phases: In most of the description of the parameters, flight phases are indicated to help understand when the parameters suffer significant changes or when they present more stable values. Flight phases are described below: (a) TAKEOFF: 1. When Air/ground (A/G) parameter condition is Gnd, it means the airplane is on the ground. Radio Altitude (RAlt) value is approximately 0 ft.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2. When Air/ground (A/G) condition changes from Gnd to Air, it indicates that the airplane is in the air. Also, Airspeed (Airspd) increases during this process. 3. Soon after Air/ground (A/G) condition changes from Gnd to Air, there is a sudden change in Elevator Surface #1 and 2 (ELVSF#1 and ELVSF#2) to positive values. 4. Make sure that Pitch Attitude (Pitch) parameter shows positive values (about 14ÃÂ°), what indicates nose up. 5. As Pressure Altitude (PrAlt) value increases, Radio Altitude (RAlt) value increases proportionally, up to approximately 2500 ft (Radio Altitude limit). Also, Static Air Temperature (SAT) value decreases as Pressure Altitude (PrAlt) value increases. (b) LANDING: 1. As the aircraft approaches for landing, Radio Altitude (RAlt) and Pressure Altitude (PrAlt) values decrease. 2. Before Air/ground (A/G) value changes from Air to Gnd, when Radio Altitude (RAlt) value is approximately 1000 ft, Flap Position (Flap) value changes from 0 to more than 15 degrees, keeping this value until some seconds after landing, when Air/ground (A/G) parameter changes from Air to Gnd. 3. Make sure that Static Air Temperature (SAT) value increases as Radio Altitude (RAlt) and Pressure Altitude (PrAlt) values decrease. 4. When Air/ground (A/G) parameter changes from Air to Gnd, there is a sudden change in Pitch Control Surface Position (ELVSF#1 and ELVSF#2) to negative values. (c) STABLE CRUISE: 1. Pitch Attitude (Pitch) and Roll Attitude (Roll) values are approximately constant. 2. Lateral Control Surface Position (AILSF#1 and AILSF#2), Pitch Control Surface Position (ELVSF#1 and ELVSF#2) and Yaw Control Surface Position (RUDDERSF) values are approximately constant. 3. Airspeed (Airspd) value is approximately constant. 4. Pressure Altitude (PrAlt) value is approximately constant. 5. Angle of Attack (AOA#1, AOA#2) values are approximately –7 degrees. 6. Longitudinal Acceleration (LgAcc) and Lateral Acceleration (LtAcc) values are approximately 0. 7. N2 Engine 1 (N2#1) and N2 Engine 2 (N2#2) parameters values are approximately 85%. 8. Normal Acceleration (NrAcc) value is around 1.0. (d) GROUND RUN: 1. This phase goes from the moment when the airplane starts running on the runway to takeoff.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2. When Air/ground (A/G) parameter is Gnd, it means the airplane is on the ground. Radio Altitude (RAlt) value is approximately 0 ft. 3. When Airspeed (Airspd) value increases, it indicates the ground run phase is starting. 4. Longitudinal Acceleration (LgAcc) value increases, and can reach approximately 0.3 G. 5. N2 Engine 1 (N2#1) and N2 Engine 2 (N2#2) parameters values are approximately 100% 6. When Air/ground (A/G) parameter changes from Gnd to Air, it indicates takeoff. It is the end of the ground run phase. (e) GROUND ROLL: 1. This phase goes from the moment when the aircraft's landing gear touches the ground, to the moment when the airplane is totally stopped on the runway. 2. When Air/ground (A/G) parameter changes from Air to Gnd, it indicates the aircraft touched the ground. 3. Soon after, Airspeed (Airspd) value decreases abruptly, indicating the use of the brakes. 4. Longitudinal Acceleration (LgAcc) values decrease, and can go down to –0.6 G. 5. (Aircraft with thrust reversers) Soon after Air/ground (A/G) parameter changes from Air to Gnd, if the thrust reversers are commanded to open, LO T/R-1 Deploy (LoDp#1), LO T/R-2 Deploy (LoDp#2), UP T/R-1 Deploy (UpDp#1) and UP T/R-2 Deploy (UpDp#2) parameters change from NotDep to Deplyd. Then, during the thrust reversers movement, parameters Thrust Rev Trans.1 (TRTr#1) and Thrust Rev Trans.2 (TRTr#2) change from Not Transit to Transit and LO T/R-1 Stowed (LoSt#1), LO T/R-2 Stowed (LoSt#2), UP T/R-1 Stowed-1 (UpSt#1) and UP T/R-2 Stowed (UpSt#2) change from Stowd to NStow.  When the thrust reversers are commanded to open, the N1 ENGINE #1 (N1#1) and N1 ENGINE #2 (N1#2) or N2 ENGINE #1 (N2#1) and N2 ENGINE #2 (N2#2) parameters increase and decrease quickly.  After a few seconds, when the thrust reversers are commanded to close, all these parameters change to their original conditions. (f) TAXI: 1. This phase corresponds to the period when the aircraft is moving on the ground with engine power, before takeoff and after landing. 2. Air/ground (A/G) value condition is Gnd. 3. Thrust/Power Engines parameters N1 Engine 1 (N1#1), N1 Engine 2 (N1#2), N2 Engine 2 (N2#1) and N2 Engine 2 (N2#2) values show variation. 4. Magnetic Heading (HDG) value shows variation. 5.

Normally PITCH ATTITUDE (Pitch) assumes values around 14ÃÂ°. • From takeoff until stable cruise, Pitch Attitude (Pitch) parameter shows positive values, what indicates nose up. 2 During Stable Cruise: • Pitch Attitude (Pitch) is approximately 0. (g) ROLL ATTITUDE (Roll): 1 During Ground Run: • Identify the moment when Airspeed (Airspd) starts increasing, before Air/ground (A/G) switch changes from Gnd to Air. This phase indicates the aircraft run for takeoff and Roll Attitude (Roll) parameter is 0. 2 During Normal Flight: • (Aircraft with RVDTs/RVITs) When Aileron Surface 1 (AILSF#1) value is negative and Aileron Surface 2 (AILSF#2) value is positive, Roll Attitude (Roll) value is positive and Magnetic Heading (HDG) value increases. When Aileron Surface 1 (AILSF#1) value is positive and Aileron Surface 2 (AILSF#2) value is negative, Roll Attitude (Roll) value is negative and Magnetic Heading (HDG) value decreases. • When Magnetic Heading (HDG) value increases, the aircraft is turning to right and Roll Attitude (Roll) value is positive. And when Magnetic Heading (HDG) value decreases, the aircraft is turning to left and Roll Attitude (Roll) value is negative. NOTE: It is possible that Roll Attitude (Roll) value changes with no Magnetic Heading (HDG) variation.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (h) MAGNETIC HEADING (HDG): NOTE: Magnetic Heading (HDG) value range is from -180ÃÂ° to +180ÃÂ°. When the aircraft is turning to the right (clockwise), the value increases. When the aircraft is turning to the left (counterclockwise) the value decreases. 1 During Taxi: • Air/ground (A/G) status is Gnd and Magnetic Heading (HDG) presents variation. When Magnetic Heading (HDG) value increases (curve to the right) Lateral Acceleration (LtAcc) value is positive. 2 During flight: • (Aircraft with RVDTs/RVITs) When Aileron Surface 1 (AILSF#1) value is negative and Aileron Surface 2 (AILSF#2) value is positive, Roll Attitude (Roll) value is positive and Magnetic Heading (HDG) value increases. When Aileron Surface 1 (AILSF#1) value is positive and Aileron Surface 2 (AILSF#2) value is negative, Roll Attitude (Roll) value is negative and Magnetic Heading (HDG) value decreases. (i) FLAP POSITION (Flap) 1 During Takeoff: • After the engines startup and before Air/ground (A/G) status changes from Gnd to Air, Flap Control Position (FlapCtPos) and Flap Position (Flap) values change from 0 to 9ÃÂ°, keeping this value for about one minute after takeoff. 2 During Stable Cruise: • Flap Control Position (FlapCtPos) and Flap Position (Flap) values are 0 during this phase. 3 During Landing: • A few minutes before Air/ground (A/G) status changes from Air to Gnd, when Landing Gear Down Locked (LGDwn) status changes from Up to Down, Flap Control Position (FlapCtPos) and Flap Position (Flap) values also change from 0 to 22ÃÂ°. At outer marker (instrument approach) or when Radio Altitude is approximately 500 ft (500/800 ft) (visual approach), Flap Control Position (FlapCtPos) and Flap Position (Flap) values change from 22ÃÂ° to 45ÃÂ° (22ÃÂ° if CAT II operation). (j) ANGLE OF ATTACK-1 (AOA#1) and ANGLE OF ATTACK-2 (AOA#2) NOTE: The parameters ANGLE OF ATTACK (AOA#1 and AOA#2) refer to the angle of the vanes. 1 During Takeoff: • Soon after takeoff, when Air/Ground (A/G) status changes from Ground to Air, Pitch Attitude (Pitch) Value is positive (around 14ÃÂº what indicates nose up), and Angle of Attack –1 and 2 (AOA#1 and AOA#2) change from negative to positive values EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-805-A/500 31-31-00 Page 245 of 264 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 During Stable Cruise: • With Heading (HDG) and Roll Attitude (ROLL) parameters constant, Angle of Attack –1 and 2 (AOA#1 and AOA#2) parameters keep a negative value around –7ÃÂº. (k) RADIO ALTITUDE (RAlt): 1 During Takeoff: • When Air/ground (A/G) condition is Gnd, Radio Altitude (RAlt) value is approximately 0 ft. • When Air/ground (A/G) condition changes from Gnd to Air, Radio Altitude (RAlt) value starts to increase. • As Pressure Altitude (PrAlt) value increases, Radio Altitude (RAlt) value increases proportionally, up to approximately 2500 ft (Radio Altitude limit). 2 During Stable Cruise • Radio Altitude (RAlt) value is constantly 2500 ft during this phase, because that is the Radio Altitude limit. 3 During Landing: • As aircraft approaches for landing, Radio Altitude (RAlt) and Pressure Altitude (PrAlt) values decrease. • When Air/ground (A/G) condition changes from Air to Gnd, Radio Altitude (RAlt) value is approximately 0. (l) GLIDE SLOPE DEVIATION -1 (GSDev#1) and GLIDE SLOPE DEVIATION -2 (GSDev#2): 1 During Takeoff and Flight: • Normally these parameters values are 0, because it is not necessary for the pilots to use the Glide Slope system in these phases. 2 During Approach: • This parameter value (given in DDM) shows the aircraft vertical deviation from the glide slope, which can be positive or negative. Its range goes from -0,8 to 0,8 DDM. The nearer its value is to 0, the nearer the airplane is to the glide slope. • Normally these parameters values tend to oscillate very near 0 when the aircraft is near the ILS ground station, (when Radio Altitude (RAlt) goes below 2500ft and DME Distance - 1 (DME#1) or DME Distance - 2 (DME#2) value is approximately 8MN) and Vertical FD Mode (FDMode-Vert) parameter status is GLIDE SLOPE. This situation remains the same until Air/ground (A/G) parameter changes from Air to Gnd. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-805-A/500 31-31-00 Page 246 of 264 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: In some cases, depending on the pilot action, these parameters can present more oscillation during approach. (m) LOCALIZER DEVIATION -1 (LDev#1) and LOCALIZER DEVIATION -2 (LDev#2): 1 During Takeoff and Flight: • Normally these parameters values are 0, because it is not necessary for the pilots to use the Localizer system in these phases. 2 During Approach: • This parameter value (given in DDM) shows the aircraft lateral deviation from the runway axis, which can be positive or negative. • Normally these parameters values tend to oscillate around 0 when the aircraft is near the ILS ground station, (when Radio Altitude (RAlt) goes below 2500ft and DME Distance - 1 (DME#1) or DME Distance - 2 (DME#2) value is approximately 8MN) and Lateral FD Mode (FDMode-Lat) parameter status is LOC. This situation remains the same until Air/ground (A/G) parameter changes from Air to Gnd. NOTE: In some cases, depending on the pilot action, these parameters can present more oscillation during approach. (n) NAVIGATION FREQUENCY -1 (NFr#1) and NAVIGATION FREQUENCY -2 (NFr#2): 1 During Flight: a These parameters can assume different values of frequencies. If these parameters assume two or more different frequencies for at least a few seconds, consider that they are being recorded correctly by the FDR. NOTE: If these parameters do not change in all FDR retrieved data, it is recommended testing them with the airplane on the ground, in real time. (o) DME DISTANCE - 1 (DME#1) and DME DISTANCE - 2 (DME#2): These parameters values indicate the line-of-sight distance from the airplane to a fixed ground station in NM. 1 During Flight: • DME Distance parameter (DME#1 or DME#2) value decreases when the airplane approaches the ground station, usually for landing. • DME Distance parameter (DME#1 or DME#2) value increases when the airplane is becoming more distant from ground station. • When DME Distance (DME#1 or DME#2) value is approximately constant and Magnetic Heading (HDG) value is increasing or decreasing constantly, it means the airplane is surrounding a ground station (usually an airport).

For example, DME#1 parameter is increasing and DME#2 is decreasing. This is a normal situation because each DME system can receive signals from different ground stations at the same time. (p) INNER MARKER - 1 (IM#1) and INNER MARKER - 2 (IM#2): 1 During Landing: • The status of these parameters will momentarily change from OFF to ON during approach, a few seconds before the aircraft touches the ground, when Air/ground (A/G) parameter condition changes from Air to Gnd. 2 During Flight: • The status of these parameters can change momentarily from OFF to ON if the aircraft is flying over a marker beacon (this is not a mandatory occurrence). (q) MIDDLE MARKER - 1 (MM#1) and MIDDLE MARKER -2 (MM#2): 1 During approach: • The status of these parameters will momentarily change from OFF to ON during approach, usually when Radio Altitude (RAlt) is approximately 200 ft. 2 During Flight: • The status of these parameters can change momentarily from OFF to ON if the aircraft is flying over a marker beacon (this is not a mandatory occurrence). (r) OUTER MARKER -1 (OM#1) and OUTER MARKER - 2 (OM#2): 1 During approach: • The status of these parameters will momentarily change from OFF to ON during approach, usually when DME Distance - 1 (DME#1) or DME Distance - 2 (DME#2) values are from 4 to 9 NM. 2 During Flight: • The status of these parameters can change momentarily from OFF to ON if the aircraft is flying over a marker beacon (this is not a mandatory occurrence). (s) PRESS-TO-TALK (PTT): The state of this parameter is normally OFF. It can change randomly to XMIT for a few seconds during any flight phase (mainly before takeoff and during approach). That indicates the use of communications systems by the pilots.
