(14) Make sure of the correct position of the passenger oxygen masks. (15) Make sure of the correct position of the fire extinguishing bottles (2). (16) Make sure of the correct installation of the portable oxygen cylinders. (17) Make sure that the galley is with all accessories, except for the movable service equipment. (18) Make sure that the first-aid kit and the escape rope are installed. (19) Inventory the aircraft with the component weights and the related balance as shown in Chart A (Basic Equipment Checklist) to determine the aircraft configuration at the time of weighing. NOTE: The Chart A (Basic Equipment Checklist) is supplied at the aircraft delivery. (20) Make sure that the aircraft is in this configuration: (a) Flaps retracted. (b) Control surfaces in neutral position. (c) Blanking plate, covers, protective carpets, shop equipment, and tools removed. (d) Cargo door, service door, emergency exits, and access panels closed. (21) Install the adapters and the load cells of the electronic weighing kit on the jacks, below the three jacking points on the fuselage and wings (Figure 201). (22) Lift the aircraft until the tires are off the ground, as written in Complete Aircraft Jacking (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-801-A/200). (23) Level the aircraft ( AMM TASK 08-20-00-500-801-A/200) and then close the main door. (24) Keep the work area clean and remove all equipment that is not necessary to do the task. J. Weighing SUBTASK 580-006-B (1) Weigh the aircraft. Refer to the instructions given in the weighing equipment manufacturer's manual. NOTE: The 45-degree latitude is a default kept on the memory of the Electronic Weighing Kit, but the degrees can be adjusted up or down in 5-degree increments to compensate for the difference in weight at the weighing location. The input of the nearest latitude value permits the Weighing Kit to do the correction automatically. (2) Write the value got in the applicable document.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (8) Weigh the aircraft again and write the result in the aircraft weighing record sheet. NOTE: If important differences between the weighing records are found, weigh the aircraft one more time and reject the most disputable result. (9) Write the aircraft weight in the applicable document. (10) Move the pilot seat back. Put the digital protractor on the seat track and measure the aircraft pitch angle (Figure 202). Read and write down the value. CAUTION:BECAUSE THE AIRCRAFT WEIGHING IS DONE ON THE GROUND, IN NORMAL ATTITUDE, WITHOUT A PREVIOUS LEVELING, THE FORMULAS BELOW WERE DEVELOPED TO GIVE THE LONGITUDINAL C.G. DISTANCE (X) FROM THE "DATUM" BASED ON THE AIRCRAFT WEIGHING. THESE FORMULAS ARE APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE AIRCRAFT IN THE BASIC EMPTY WEIGHT CONDITION (REFER TO DEFINITION IN THE WEIGHT AND BALANCE MANUAL), WITHOUT FUEL ON BOARD, AND FOR THE SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION (WITH THE THRUST REVERSERS INSTALLED OR NOT). (11) To get the longitudinal CG distance (X) from the "DATUM", use the formulas below as applicable. (a) Aircraft equipped with Thrust Reversers. • Formula: X (m) = (1/cos α) [14.4403 (1 - N / W) - 1.07] + 3.2615 - 0.9297 sin α. (b) Aircraft not equipped with Thrust Reversers. • Formula: X (m) = (1/cos α) [14.4403 (1 - N / W) - 1.07] + 3.2615 - 0.9184 sin α. • Where: 1. X (m) = Distance from "Datum" measured parallel to the fuselage center line, in meters. 2. W = N + R = Total aircraft weight (Kg). 3. N = Nose landing gear reaction, total (Kg). 4. R = Main landing gear reaction, total (Kg). 5. α = Aircraft pitch attitude: NOTE: The sign of the pitch angle must be taken into account when you get sin α. • Nose up: α &gt; 0 → sin α &gt; 0 • Nose down: α &lt; 0 → sin α &lt; 0 (12) Write down the value of longitudinal CG distance (X) in the applicable document. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-007-B (1) Remove the aircraft from the platform scales (Figure 202).
