			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • MAKE SURE THAT THE THRUST REVERSERS ARE DEENERGIZED. ENERGIZED CIRCUITS CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE HYDRAULIC TEST STAND IS NOT CONNECTED. • THE PHOSPHATE-ESTER-BASE OIL IS HIGHLY CORROSIVE AND CAUSES INJURY TO THE EYES AND SKIN. BE CAREFUL NOT TO TOUCH THIS OIL. YOU MUST USE GLOVES AND GOGGLES. CAUTION: • ALWAYS CLEAN THE HYDRAULIC FLUID THAT FALLS FROM THE THRUST REVERSERS. DAMAGE COULD COME FROM ITS CORROSIVE ACTION. • USE APPLICABLE CONTAINERS TO COLLECT THE REMAINING FLUIDS FROM THE OPEN LINES, TO KEEP THE WORK AREA CLEAN AND SAFE. (1) Put the workstand under the engine thrust reverser. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (3) Put a DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign on the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (4) Manually operate the ICU to prevent the operation of the thrust reverser (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). WARNING: DO NOT APPLY HYDRAULIC POWER TO THE AIRCRAFT, AND DO NOT OPERATE THE THRUST REVERSER WHILE THE MAINTENANCE PERSONS ARE AT WORK. (5) Remove access panels 416AB or 426AB ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100) as applicable, to get access to the sequence valve. J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A CAUTION: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU DISCONNECT HYDRAULIC LINES. SKYDROL FLUID IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS. (1) Loosen the nuts (1), disconnect the hydraulic lines, and install applicable caps in the tubes and in the sequence valve ports. (2) Remove the bolts (2), and washers (3).

ENERGIZED CIRCUITS CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE HYDRAULIC TEST STAND IS NOT CONNECTED. (1) Install the sequence valve (4) on the torsion box attaching support (5) with the bolts (2) and washers (3). (2) Remove the caps from the sequence valve (4) ports and hydraulic lines and connect their nuts (1). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (2) Remove the DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign from the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (3) Manually operate the ICU to put the thrust reverser back to the serviceable condition (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). (4) Do the engine thrust-reverser operational check ( AMM TASK 78-31-01-700-801-A/500 - two cycles minimum), and check the system for leaks. (5) Install access panels 416AB or 426AB ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100), as applicable. (6) Remove the workstand from the work area.
