			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 78-33-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. AIR/GROUND INPUT SIGNAL TO THRUST REVERSER (TR) SYSTEM - OPERATIONAL CHECK A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the operational check of the Air/Ground Input Signal to the Thrust Reverser (TR) System. (2) When the AIR/GND circuit breakers are opened, the recording function of the FDR starts and the data stored in the FDR are overwritten. If it is necessary to keep the data stored in the FDR, open the FDR circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel. Or, if it is necessary to keep the FDR on, do an FDR downloading ( AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500). (3) This procedure is applicable to the LH and RH Thrust Reversers (TR). B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (11) Select "ANALOG" and read the TLA on the screen, in the TLA area. WARNING: TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL, BEFORE YOU OPEN THE N2 CIRCUIT BREAKERS, MAKE SURE THAT SENSORS PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, AND PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET AT OFF. (12) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them. • N2 SIGNAL 1A/1B. • N2 SIGNAL 2A/2B. (13) Set the thrust lever to the IDLE position. J. Functional Check of Thrust-Reverser Control-Lever Microswitches (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Do the functional check of the TR control-lever microswitches as follows: WARNING: BEFORE THE FUNCTIONAL CHECK OF THE TR CONTROL LEVER MICROSWITCHES, YOU MUST PREVENT THE TR OPERATION WITH THE MANUAL OPERATION OF THE ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). (a) Set the thrust lever to the THRUST SET position. Read the TLA value on GSE 130. Result:  1 The value of the TLA must be 75ÃÂ° (ÃÂ± 3ÃÂ°). (b) Lock the thrust lever with the friction lock knob. (c) Do a check to know if there is continuity between pin D and pin F of connector P1269 (for TR1 control-lever microswitch #6) and between pin 15 and pin 17 of connector P1270 (for TR2 control-lever microswitch #6). Result:  1 There is continuity between the pins of the connectors. (d) Do a check to know if there is continuity between pin D and pin G of connector P1269 (for TR1 control-lever microswitch #6) and between pin 15 and pin 18 of connector P1270 (for TR2 control-lever microswitch #6). Result:  1 There is no continuity between the pins of the connectors. (e) Do a check to know if there is continuity between pin E and pin H of connector P1269 (for TR1 control-lever microswitch #2) and between pin 16 and pin 19 of connector P1270 (for TR2 control-lever microswitch #2). Result:  1 There is no continuity between the pins of the connectors. (f) Release the friction lock and set the thrust lever to the 17.5ÃÂ° (ÃÂ± 0.5ÃÂ°) TLA position. Lock the thrust lever with the friction lock knob. Result:  1 Read the TLA value on GSE 130. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-803-A/500 78-33-00 Page 20 of 23 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
