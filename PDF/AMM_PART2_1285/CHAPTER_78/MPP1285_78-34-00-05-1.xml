			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL THRUST REVERSER INDICATING - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do the operational check of the thrust-reverser (TR) indicating system. B. The Thrust Reverser System is a very complex system and thus, to do the Operational Check of the indicating system, it is necessary to divide it into dedicated subtasks. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 78-34-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. THRUST-REVERSER (TR) INDICATING SYSTEM - OPERATIONAL CHECK A. General (1) Obey these instructions to do the operational check of the thrust-reverser indicating system. (2) When the AIR/GND circuit breakers are opened, the recording function of the FDR starts and the data stored in the FDR are overwritten. If it is necessary to keep the data stored in the FDR, open the FDR circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel. Or, if it is necessary to keep the FDR on, do an FDR downloading ( AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500). (3) These procedures are applicable to the check of the LH and RH thrust-reverser indicating system. (4) Such indication as "thrust lever 1(2)" means: thrust lever 1 for the left thrust reverser and thrust lever 2 for the right thrust reverser. B.
