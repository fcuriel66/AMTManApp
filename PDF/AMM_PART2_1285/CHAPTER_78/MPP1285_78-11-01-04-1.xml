CAUTION: DO NOT HIT THE EXHAUST NOZZLE, OR THE AIRCRAFT, DURING THE REMOVAL PROCEDURE. (1) Get access and install the lifter to the engine exhaust nozzle. NOTE: The front adapter of the lifter permits RH and LH side installation. Put the lifter on the adapter right side to install the right exhaust nozzle, and on the adapter left side to install the left exhaust nozzle. (2) Connect the hoist to the lifter, and adjust the hoist correctly. (3) Loosen the bolts (1), washers (2) and nuts (3) that attach the exhaust nozzle (4) to the engine mounting flange. (4) Adjust the height of the hoist correctly. (5) Loosen the torque of the bolts (1) and nuts (3). (6) Remove the bolts (1), washers (2), and nuts (3), but let a minimum of four bolts with washers and nuts to attach the exhaust nozzle at the top of the engine rear mount ring. NOTE: When you remove the nuts (3) from the bolts (1) in the upper and lower mounts, be careful and do not let the bolt get out of its place, if you will install the exhaust nozzle again. (7) Adjust the height of the hoist again, remove the remaining bolts on the top of the engine rear mount ring, and remove the exhaust nozzle from the engine. (8) Put the exhaust nozzle on a wooden platform to prevent damage. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 78-11-01 Page 3 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
