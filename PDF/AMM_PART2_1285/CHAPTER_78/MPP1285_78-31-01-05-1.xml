			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Pressurize the aircraft hydraulic system with HTS ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/ 200) or with EMDP ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). NOTE: • During the test, turn on only the applicable hydraulic pump at a time to operate the related thrust reverser, when possible. • If you pressurize the hydraulic system with the EMDP, the "HYD SYS 1(2) FAIL" message can show momentarily during the test. This is a normal behavior. This occurs because the momentary pressure in the hydraulic system decreases. (a) Release the thrust lever idle lock trigger, and move the thrust lever to the maximum reverse position. Result: 1 The thrust reverser doors go to the maximum deployed position. NOTE: When you operate only one thrust lever, the FADEC permits the N1 request indication on the EICAS. But if you operate the two thrust levers, the FADEC will inhibit the N1 request indication unless the engines are in operation. 2 Make sure that the EICAS screen shows the message "REV" (green color). (b) Move the thrust lever to the idle position. Result: 1 The thrust reverser doors go to the stowed position. 2 Make sure that the "REV" message goes out of view on the EICAS screen. (2) After you complete the test, make sure that the "HYD SYS 1(2) FAIL" message is not active on the EICAS. (3) Examine the thrust reverser for general conditions and oil leaks. (4) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/ 200). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tags from them. • N2 SIGNAL 1A/1B • N2 SIGNAL 2A/2B (2) Remove the DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200) from the aircraft.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 78-31-01-820-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 3. THRUST REVERSER - RIGGING PROCEDURE A. General (1) Obey these instructions to do the rigging of the thrust reverser. (2) Use GSE 434 (Rigging Tool) to do this procedure. (3) This procedure is applicable to the LH and RH thrust reversers and to the upper and lower pivot doors. (4) Make sure that all the equipment is in good condition and at the correct calibration standard. (5) Do a test of the multi-meter audible function, mare sure it works correctly. (6) In the rigging procedure there are some definitions to be considered, as follows: (a) DATUM: This is the base position from where you measure all other dimensions. (b) HOOK BALANCE: The allowable difference between the LH and RH door hooks in relation to the S-hooks. (c) IN TO WIND or OUT OF WIND: These are the two different positions that a pivot door can be in when it is in the STOW position: • IN TO WIND: This is when the level of the pivot door is above the torsion box panel. • OUT OF WIND: This is when the level of the pivot door is below the torsion box panel. (d) OVERSTOW: This is the first movement of the door in the deploy cycle when it moves below the torsion box panel in order to release the primary locks. (7) The table below gives the relation between the component replaced and the rigging checks to be done.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 78-31-01-820-802-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 4. THRUST REVERSER - MANUAL RIGGING PROCEDURE A. General (1) Obey these instructions to do the rigging of the thrust reverser. (2) Use a depth gauge to do this procedure. NOTE: Make sure that the depth gauge is in good condition and at the correct calibration standard. (3) Do a test of the multi-meter audible function, mare sure it works correctly. (4) This procedure is applicable to the LH and RH thrust reversers and to the upper and lower pivot doors. (5) In the rigging procedure there are some definitions to be considered, as follows: (a) DATUM: This is the base position from where you measure all other dimensions. (b) HOOK BALANCE: The allowable difference between the LH and RH door hooks in relation to the S-hooks. (c) IN TO WIND or OUT OF WIND: These are the two different positions that a pivot door can be in when it is in the STOW position: • IN TO WIND: This is when the level of the pivot door is above the torsion box panel. • OUT OF WIND: This is when the level of the pivot door is below the torsion box panel. (d) OVERSTOW: This is the first movement of the door in the deploy cycle when it moves below the torsion box panel in order to release the primary locks. (6) The table below gives the relation between the component replaced and the rigging checks to be done.
