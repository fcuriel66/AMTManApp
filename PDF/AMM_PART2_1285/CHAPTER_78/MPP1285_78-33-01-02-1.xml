			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL ISOLATION CONTROL UNIT (ICU) - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to inhibit and de-inhibit the Isolation Control Unit (ICU). B. When the thrust lever commands the thrust reverser in the normal conditions, the ICU supplies hydraulic pressure to operate the system. With the ICU lever in the inhibit position, the ICU causes a blockage of the hydraulic fluid that goes to the system. This inhibits the operation of the thrust reverser. C. Each thrust reverser receives the hydraulic pressure from one ICU. The ICUs 1 and 2 are installed to the fuselage tail cone. D. These procedures are the same for the ICU 1 and ICU 2. E. ICU 1 is related to the LH Thrust-Reverser and ICU 2 is related to the RH Thrust-Reverser. F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Get access to the ICU. J. Inhibit ICU (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 980-002-A WARNING: WHEN YOU INHIBIT THE ICU FOR FLIGHT OPERATION, YOU MUST LOCK THE THRUST REVERSER DOORS IN THE STOWED POSITION WITH THE INHIBITION BOLTS (AMM TASK 78-31-01-980-801-A/200). (1) Remove the quick release pin from its storage position. (2) Manually push the ICU inhibition lever to the inhibit position. This will align the hole in the ICU housing with the hole in the inhibition lever. (3) Install the quick release pin to the aligned holes, and make sure that the inhibition lever contacts the ICU microswitch. K. De-inhibit ICU (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 980-003-A WARNING: WHEN YOU DE-INHIBIT THE ICU, YOU MUST REMOVE THE INHIBITION BOLTS (AMM TASK 78-31-01-980-801-A/200) FROM THE THRUST REVERSER DOORS, IF THEY ARE INSTALLED. (1) Remove the quick release pin to disconnect the ICU housing from the inhibition lever. (2) Release the ICU inhibition lever to go back to the de-inhibit position. (3) Install the quick release pin to its storage position. L. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the access panel 312AR (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100) and remove the ladder.
