			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TR EXHAUST - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to open/close and/or lock/unlock the thrust-reverser exhaust doors. B. This section also gives the procedures to isolate/reconnect the thrust-reverser hydraulic system if there is a leak. C. These tasks give you the procedures to open/close and/or lock/unlock the doors in the stowed and in the deployed positions. The inhibition bolts and plugs, and the hold-open stays are stored in the torsion box firewall. D. These procedures are applicable to the LH and RH thrust reversers, when you need to do a maintenance task. E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • DURING THE THRUST REVERSER OPERATION PROCEDURES, MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A TECHNICIAN (EXTERNAL OBSERVER) NEAR THE AIRCRAFT TO MONITOR THE THRUST REVERSER OPERATION. USE THE REAR INTERPHONE SYSTEM (RAMP) FOR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE COCKPIT AND THE EXTERNAL OBSERVER. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) The aircraft must be on the ground, and the landing gear must be down and locked. (3) Put the workstand in the work area. NOTE: Make sure that the workstand will not interfere with the thrust reverser doors during the opening procedure. (4) Open access door 312AR (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100). (5) Put the thrust lever to the “IDLE” position. WARNING: TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL, BEFORE YOU OPEN THE N2 CIRCUIT BREAKERS, MAKE SURE THAT THE SENSORS PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, AND PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET TO OFF. (6) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach DO-NOT-CLOSE tags to them. – N2 SIGNAL - 1A/1B – N2 SIGNAL - 2A/2B (7) Energize the aircraft with a DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Opening Procedure (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 940-002-A WARNING: • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • MAKE SURE THAT THE LANDING GEAR SAFETY PINS ARE INSTALLED TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). • MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO OBJECTS, PERSONS, AND SUPPORT EQUIPMENT IN THE AREA, BEFORE YOU OPERATE THE THRUST REVERSER. • BE CAREFUL: THE NOMINAL PRESSURE OF THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM IS 3000 PSI. THUS, A LEAKAGE IN THE HYDRAULIC LINES COULD CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT. CAUTION: • DO NOT DO THE POWER-BACK OPERATION DURING MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE HYDRAULIC LINES ARE CONNECTED NOT TO LET THE HYDRAULIC OIL FALL OUT. • ALWAYS CLEAN THE HYDRAULIC FLUID THAT FALLS FROM THE ENGINE. DAMAGE CAN COME FROM ITS CORROSIVE ACTION. (1) Pressurize the aircraft hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). NOTE: During the test, turn on only the applicable hydraulic pump to operate the related thrust reverser, when possible. (2) Open the thrust reverser as follows: (a) Release the thrust lever idle lock trigger, and move the thrust lever to the maximum reverser position. Result: 1 The thrust reverser doors go to the maximum deployed position. NOTE: When you operate only one thrust lever, the FADEC permits the N1 request indication on the EICAS. But, if you operate the two thrust levers, the FADEC will inhibit the N1 request indication unless the engines are in operation. 2 Make sure that the EICAS screen shows the message “REV” (green). (3) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/ 200). (4) Manually inhibit the ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). (5) Lock the thrust reverser doors in the deployed position (AMM TASK 78-31-01-980-802- A/200).

General (1) Obey these instructions to isolate/reconnect the thrust-reverser hydraulic system from/to the aircraft hydraulic system. There is one subtask to isolate the system and other to reconnect it. (2) Do this procedure when you have a leak in the thrust-reverser hydraulic system. Refer to the Dispatch Deviations Procedures Manual (DDPM 78-30-00) before you get approval for aircraft flight. B.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-005-A WARNING: • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY IS REMOVED FROM THRUST REVERSERS. ENERGIZED CIRCUITS CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE HYDRAULIC TEST STAND IS NOT CONNECTED. THE THRUST LEVERS MUST BE IN THE IDLE OR FORWARD THRUST POSITION BEFORE YOU START THE JOB. • THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE GOGGLES AND RUBBER GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. CAUTION: • ALWAYS CLEAN THE HYDRAULIC FLUID THAT FALLS FROM THE ENGINE. DAMAGE CAN COME FROM ITS CORROSIVE ACTION. • USE APPLICABLE CONTAINERS TO COLLECT THE REMAINING FLUIDS FROM THE OPEN LINES TO KEEP THE WORK AREA CLEAN AND SAFE. (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them.
