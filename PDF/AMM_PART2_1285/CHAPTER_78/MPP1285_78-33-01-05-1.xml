			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Put the workstand in the work location. (3) Remove DAU 2 ( AMM TASK 31-41-01-000-801-A/400). (4) Energize the aircraft with DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). WARNING: BE CAREFUL WITH THE AIRCRAFT HYDRAULIC LINES: THE NOMINAL PRESSURE OF THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM IS 3,000 PSI. A LEAKAGE COULD CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE HYDRAULIC LINES ARE CONNECTED NOT TO LET THE HYDRAULIC OIL FALL OUT. (5) Pressurize the aircraft hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). WARNING: BEFORE YOU OPEN THE N2 CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL, MAKE SURE THAT SENSORS PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, AND PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET TO OFF. (6) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag on them. • N2 SIGNAL 1A/1B. • N2 SIGNAL 2A/2B. (7) Set the thrust lever to the IDLE position. J. Operationally Check Isolation Control Unit (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) To do the operational check of the ICU-1 and ICU-2, do the steps below: (a) Do a check to make sure that there is no continuity between pin A-36 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-38 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is no continuity to the ground. WARNING: PERSONS MUST KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE THRUST REVERSER DOORS TO PREVENT INJURY. (b) Set the thrust lever to the MAX REV position and do a check to make sure that there is continuity between pin A-36 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-38 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2) during the cycle of operation of the thrust reverser doors. Result: 1 There is continuity to the ground. 2 The thrust reverser doors deploy fully. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 78-33-01 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: PERSONS MUST KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE THRUST REVERSER DOORS TO PREVENT INJURY. (c) Set the thrust lever to the IDLE position. Result: 1 The thrust reverser doors stow fully. (d) Do a check to make sure that, after 6 seconds, there is no continuity between pin A-36 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-38 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is no continuity to the ground. (e) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200). (f) Set the ICU-1 (2) inhibit lever to the inhibit position. (g) Pressurize the aircraft hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (h) Do a check to make sure that there is no continuity between pin A-36 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-38 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is no continuity to the ground. (i) Do a check to make sure that there is continuity between pin A-31 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-33 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is continuity to the ground. WARNING: PERSONS MUST KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE THRUST REVERSER DOORS TO PREVENT INJURY. (j) Set the thrust lever to the MAX REV position. Result: 1 The thrust reverser doors do not deploy. (k) Do a check to make sure that there is no continuity between pin A-36 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-38 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is no continuity to the ground. (l) Do a check to make sure that there is continuity between pin A-31 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-33 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is continuity to the ground. WARNING: PERSONS MUST KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE THRUST REVERSER DOORS TO PREVENT INJURY. (m) Set the thrust lever to the IDLE position.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (n) Do a check to make sure that there is no continuity between pin A-36 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-38 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is no continuity to the ground. (o) Do a check to make sure that there is continuity between pin A-31 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-33 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is continuity to the ground. (p) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200). (q) Set the ICU inhibit lever to the NOT inhibit position. (r) Pressurize the aircraft hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (s) Do a check to make sure that there is no continuity between pin A-31 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1018 (for ICU-1) and between pin A-33 and the ground at DAU-2 connector J1020 (for ICU-2). Result: 1 There is no continuity to the ground. WARNING: PERSONS MUST KEEP A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE THRUST REVERSER DOORS TO PREVENT INJURY. (t) Set the thrust lever to the MAX REV position, and then to the IDLE position. Result: 1 The thrust reverser doors will do a complete cycle of operation. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Make sure that the thrust lever is in the IDLE position. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them. • N2 SIGNAL 1A/1B. • N2 SIGNAL 2A/2B. (3) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/ 200). (4) Install DAU 2 ( AMM TASK 31-41-01-400-801-A/400). (5) Remove the DC Power Supply from the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/ 200). (6) Remove the workstand from the work location.
