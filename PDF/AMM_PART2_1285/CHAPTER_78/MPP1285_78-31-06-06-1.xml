			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • MAKE SURE THAT THE THRUST REVERSERS ARE DEENERGIZED. ENERGIZED CIRCUITS CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE HYDRAULIC TEST STAND IS NOT CONNECTED. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE HYDRAULIC LINES ARE CONNECTED NOT TO PERMIT THE HYDRAULIC OIL TO FALL OUT. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Put the workstand under the engine thrust reverser. (3) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (4) Put a DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign on the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (5) Inhibit the ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). (6) Remove the upper door ( AMM TASK 78-31-02-000-801-A/400) or lower door ( AMM TASK 78-31-03-000-801-A/400), as applicable. J. Inspection/Check SUBTASK 211-002-A WARNING: DO NOT APPLY HYDRAULIC POWER TO THE AIRCRAFT, AND DO NOT OPERATE THE THRUST REVERSER WHILE THE MAINTENANCE PERSONS ARE AT WORK. WARNING: METHYL-ETHYL-KETONE (MEK) IS IRRITANT AND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. THIS CHEMICAL PRODUCT CAN CAUSE INJURIES. TO USE IT, OBEY THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS. (1) Clean the thrust-reverser pivot bearing with a dry lint-free cloth with methyl-ethyl- ketone (MEK) or similar. NOTE: • Let the solvent dry before you turn the ball to make sure that the lubricant applied to the inner surface of the bearing case is not removed. • Try to remove all metallic unwanted material from the ball.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Use GSE 341 to prevent the tilting movement of the pivot-door bearing ball and permit the bearing axial play measurement. The axial play must be less than or equal to 1.5 mm. (3) There can be grooves on the ball surface. They are permitted if the axial play is within the value specified in step (2). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A CAUTION: EXAMINE ALL THE WORK AREAS TO MAKE SURE YOU DID NOT LET TOOLS OR OTHER EQUIPMENT STAY BEHIND. (1) Install the upper door ( AMM TASK 78-31-02-400-801-A/400) or lower door ( AMM TASK 78-31-03-400-801-A/400), as applicable. (2) Deinhibit the ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close these circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (4) Remove the DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign from the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (5) Remove the workstand from the work area.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Measure the inside diameter of the hole in the pivot fitting in which the ball bearing nut will be installed. With a three-point self-centering micrometer, measure around all the perimeter of the hole in the pivot fitting. Record the largest dimension. Refer to DET. C, SECTION D-D of Figure 601. (4) Measure the thickness of the pivot fitting in which the ball bearing nut will be installed. Use a micrometer to measure around the entire perimeter of the bore in the pivot fitting. Record the smallest dimension. Refer to DET. C, SECTION D-D of Figure 601. (5) The diameter dimension got in step (3) must be less than or equal to 41.335 mm (1.627"). Refer to SRM 54-30-02/201 to repair the hole, if necessary. (6) The thickness dimension got in step (4) must be greater than or equal to 5.30 mm (0.21”). K.
