			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • MAKE SURE THAT THE THRUST REVERSERS ARE DEENERGIZED. ENERGIZED CIRCUITS CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE HYDRAULIC TEST STAND IS NOT CONNECTED. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE HYDRAULIC LINES ARE CONNECTED NOT TO LET THE HYDRAULIC OIL FALL OUT. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Put the workstand under the engine thrust reverser. (3) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (4) Put a DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign on the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (5) Inhibit the ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). (6) Remove the deploy microswitches (AMM TASK 78-34-02-000-801-A/400). J. Inspection/Check (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 211-002-A WARNING: DO NOT APPLY HYDRAULIC POWER TO THE AIRCRAFT, AND DO NOT OPERATE THE THRUST REVERSER WHILE THE MAINTENANCE PERSONS ARE AT WORK. (1) Use a caliper to make sure that the switch arm is within the wear limits of 0.7 mm (0.028") deep. Refer to SECTION D-D, DET. C of Figure 601. (2) Visually examine the arm of the deploy switch. If you find damage along the length of the arm, do the procedure given in reverser manufacturer's CMM 78-30-00 (Testing &amp; troubleshooting - Table 105). (3) Put a square on the switch face to make sure that the switch arm is parallel to the square. Bending is not acceptable. Refer to DET. C of Figure 601. (4) Use a multimeter to do a continuity test at the switch pins as follows: (a) Manually operate the switch and keep the lever arm pushed. Make sure that there is continuity between pins 1 and 2 and between pins 4 and 5. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 78-34-02 Page 3 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Release the switch arm and make sure that there is continuity between pins 1 and 3 and between pins 4 and 6. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A CAUTION: EXAMINE ALL THE WORK AREAS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DID NOT LET TOOLS OR OTHER EQUIPMENT STAY BEHIND. (1) Install the deploy microswitch (AMM TASK 78-34-02-400-801-A/400). (2) Deinhibit the ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close these circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (4) Remove the DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign from the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (5) Remove the workstand from the work area.
