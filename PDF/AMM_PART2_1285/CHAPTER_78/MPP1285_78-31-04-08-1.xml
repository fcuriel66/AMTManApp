			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Thrust reverser I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Put the workstand under the engine thrust reverser. (2) Open the thrust-reverser doors (AMM TASK 78-31-01-940-801-A/200). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (4) Put a DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign on the instrument panel, in the cockpit. J. Sealing Repair (Figure 801)  SUBTASK 350-002-A (1) Do an inspection of the rubber seal and measure the damage. (2) If the damage exceeds the limits that follow, make the patch repair (SUBTASK 350-003-A) or replace the seal (AMM MPP 78-31-04/400). (a) The maximum permitted cut length is 30mm (1.180 in). (b) The maximum permitted cut width is 3 mm (0.118 in). (c) Minimum permitted separation between damaged spots is 50 mm (2.0 in). (d) The maximum permitted quantity of damaged spots is 5 (five). (3) If the damage is in the limits, make the sealing repair that follows: WARNING: USE SEALANT OR SOLVENT IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. PREVENT VAPOR INHALATION AND LONG SKIN CONTACT WITH THESE PRODUCTS. (a) Clean all mating surfaces of the damage with solvent. NOTE: Carefully compress the seal to get access to the damage internal surfaces and clean them. (b) Compress the rubber to get full access to the damage. WARNING: USE SEALANT OR SOLVENT IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. PREVENT VAPOR INHALATION AND LONG SKIN CONTACT WITH THESE PRODUCTS. (c) Fill the damage void with silicone adhesive. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 78-31-04 Page 3 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (d) With a plastic spatula, remove excess silicone adhesive. (e) Wait the silicone to cure for 6 hours (minimum). (4) Make sure that there are no cracks in the repaired area. K. Patch Repair (Figure 802)  SUBTASK 350-003-A (1) Cut and remove a section of the damaged seal. The section must be a minimum of 40 mm (1.57 in) long. WARNING: USE SEALANT OR SOLVENT IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. PREVENT VAPOR INHALATION AND LONG SKIN CONTACT WITH THESE PRODUCTS. (2) Use solvent to remove all silicone adhesive from the seal support. (3) Cut a section of a new seal equal to the section removed in step (1). (4) Cut two 40 mm (1.57 in) long sleeves from the new seal. NOTE: The repair section (step 3) must be cut from a new seal; other lengths must be cut from the new seal in the same region for you to make sleeves A and B (step 4). These sleeves are then cut along their length and tightened for them to have a smaller diameter than the seal. Thus, they can be put into the seal repair section. But, before the installation of the sleeves, they must have the excess material removed. (5) With a Scotch Brite sponge, lightly roughen the two mating surfaces of the repair section and of each end (A) and (B) of the cut seal (inner and outer surfaces). WARNING: USE SEALANT OR SOLVENT IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. PREVENT VAPOR INHALATION AND LONG SKIN CONTACT WITH THESE PRODUCTS. (6) Clean all mating surfaces of the repair section with solvent. (7) Install the first sleeve into the repair section; apply silicone adhesive to one half of the sleeve to a thickness of 1 mm (0.04 in). The sleeve must be halfway out of the repair section. To make sure that there is a good sealing, apply pressure to the seal until the silicone adheres. (8) Do step (7) again for the second sleeve. (9) Remove all unwanted silicone. (10) Let the sealant cure for one hour at 20ÃÂ°C. (11) Install the repair section as follows: apply silicone adhesive to each half of the sleeves and to the two lips of the seal support. Make sure that the holes in the repair section point to the inside of the thrust reverser before you engage each sleeve inside ends (A) and (B). (12) Apply a layer of silicone adhesive to the two sides of the seal and fillet the joint. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 78-31-04 Page 4 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (13) Remove all unwanted silicone adhesive and let it set for as much time as possible (a minimum of 6 hours). (14) After setting, compress the section and make sure that there is no crack in the adhesive bead. L. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, close these circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (2) Remove the DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign from the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (3) Close the thrust-reverser doors ( AMM TASK 78-31-01-940-802-A/200). (4) Remove the workstand from the work area. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 78-31-04 Page 5 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
