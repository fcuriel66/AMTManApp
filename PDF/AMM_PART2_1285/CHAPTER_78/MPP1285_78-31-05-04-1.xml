Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A WARNING: • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE. A GOOD FLOW OF AIR MUST BE AVAILABLE WHEN THE WORK IS DONE IN A CLOSED AREA. CAUTION: • MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE HYDRAULIC LINES ARE CONNECTED NOT TO PERMIT THE HYDRAULIC OIL TO FALL OUT. • DO NOT PERMIT THE CLEANING PRODUCT TO TOUCH PAINT-FINISH SURFACES NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THEM. • USE CLEAN, SOFT (COTTON), NON-SYNTHETIC AND LINT-FREE CLOTHS ONLY. DO NOT PUT REMAINING CLEANING MATERIAL BACK INTO ORIGINAL CONTAINERS TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION. • DO NOT POUR CLEANING PRODUCT DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE TO BE CLEANED. • DO NOT PERMIT CLEANING PRODUCT TO EVAPORATE BEFORE IT IS DRIED WITH THE CLOTH. (1) Soak a cloth with methyl-ethyl-ketone and clean the pivot bolts (4) that attach the door to the beam structure, and their receptacles. (2) Dry the area with other clean and dry cloth before the methyl-ethyl-ketone evaporates. (3) Do steps 1 and 2 again. Replace the cloths when they become dirty. Stop only when no signs of discoloration stay in the dry cloth. (4) Make sure that, on the circuit breaker panel, the circuit breakers below are open and tagged: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • HYD. ELEC.
