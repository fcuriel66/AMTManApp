Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Put the workstand in the work location. (3) Remove access panels 416BB/416HT/426BB/426HT ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (4) Energize the aircraft with a DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). WARNING: • BE CAREFUL WITH THE AIRCRAFT HYDRAULIC LINES: THE NOMINAL PRESSURE OF THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM IS 3,000 PSI. A LEAKAGE COULD CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL. • BEFORE YOU OPEN THE N2 CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL, MAKE SURE THAT SENSORS PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, AND PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET TO OFF. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them. • N2 SIGNAL 1A/1B • N2 SIGNAL 2A/2B (6) Open the thrust reverser exhaust door (AMM TASK 78-31-01-940-801-A/200). (7) Manually actuate the ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200) to inhibit the Thrust Reverser operation.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Operationally Check Thrust Reverser 2RY and 3RY Locks (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 78-30-00/200 WHEN YOU DO THE THRUST REVERSER MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE HYDRAULIC LINES ARE CONNECTED NOT TO PERMIT THE HYDRAULIC OIL TO FALL OUT. (1) To do the operational check of the thrust reverser (TR) tertiary (3RY) lock, follow these steps: (a) Manually actuate the upper and lower 3RY lock forks to the locked position. Result: 1 The 3RY locks go to the locked position. (b) Disconnect electrical connector P1790 (upper tertiary lock) and electrical connector P1785 (lower tertiary lock) for TR 1 and TR 2. (c) Do a check to know if there is continuity between pin 1 and pin 2 of connector P1790 (for upper tertiary lock) and between pin 1 and pin 2 of connector P1785 (for lower tertiary lock). Result: 1 There is continuity between the pins of the connectors. (d) Do a short movement in the upper door to remove it from the deployed position. Result: 1 The two (upper/lower) 3RY locks unlock. (e) Do a check to know if there is continuity between pin 3 and pin 2 of connector P1790 (for upper tertiary lock) and between pin 3 and pin 2 of connector P1785 (for lower tertiary lock). Result: 1 There is continuity between the pins of the connectors. (f) Manually deploy the upper door. (g) Manually actuate the upper and lower 3RY lock forks to the locked position. Result: 1 The 3RY locks go to the locked position. (h) Do a check to know if there is continuity between pin 1 and pin 2 of connector P1790 (for upper tertiary lock) and between pin 1 and pin 2 of connector P1785 (for lower tertiary lock). Result: 1 There is continuity between the pins of the connectors. (i) Do a short movement in the lower door to remove it from the deployed position Result: 1 The two (upper/lower) 3RY locks unlock. (j) Do a check to know if there is continuity between pin 3 and pin 2 of connector P1790 (for upper tertiary lock) and between pin 3 and pin 2 of connector P1785 (for lower tertiary lock).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 There is continuity between the pins of the connectors. (k) Manually deploy the lower door. (2) To do the operational check of the thrust reverser (TR) secondary (2RY) lock, follow these steps: (a) Unlock the thrust reverser exhaust door (AMM TASK 78-31-01-980-802-A/200). (b) Manually actuate each thrust reverser door to close it until the 2RY lock operates. Result: 1 The thrust reverser door is locked. NOTE: The 3RY lock and the 1RY lock will operate together with the 2RY lock. (c) Release the 3RY lock with the manual override (AMM TASK 78-32-05-980-801- A/200). (d) Unlock the 1RY lock (AMM TASK 78-32-02-980-801-A/200). (e) Manually actuate each thrust reverser door to open it. Result: 1 You cannot open it manually. (f) Release the 2RY lock with the manual override (AMM TASK 78-32-01-980-801- A/200) and simultaneously pull the door. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Connect electrical connectors P1785, and P1790 on TR 1 and TR 2. (2) Install access panels 416BB/416HT/426BB/426HT ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close these circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from them. • N2 SIGNAL 1A/1B • N2 SIGNAL 2A/2B (4) Do a thrust reverser operational test ( AMM TASK 78-31-01-700-801-A/500) and examine for general conditions, oil leaks, and correct operation. (5) Remove the DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200) from the aircraft. (6) Remove the workstand from the work location.
