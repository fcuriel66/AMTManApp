If it is above flush, use the positive sign (+). [2] The result is the difference between the actuation position value and the stowed position value. (3) Put the workstand under the engine thrust reverser. (4) With a marker pen, make a mark on the torsion box structure at the point forward of the inhibition bolt hole. (5) Cycle the thrust-reverser once ( AMM TASK 78-31-01-700-801-A/500). (6) Make sure that the thrust reverser is in the stowed position. (7) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • THRUST REVERSER 1/2. • CMC. • HYD. ELEC. PUMP 1/2. (8) Put a DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-THRUST-REVERSERS sign on the instrument panel, in the cockpit. (9) Inhibit the ICU (AMM TASK 78-33-01-980-801-A/200). CAUTION: TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE FRONT EDGE OF THE PIVOT DOOR AND THE TORSION BOX STRUCTURE SKIN, DO NOT USE TOOLS TO PULL THE DOORS OUT (Figure 501). (10) Push the rear edge of the door inward to lift the front edge of the door. NOTE: The movement of the doors is such that you cannot see it, and it is limited by the primary lock. (11) With a caliper or a depth gauge, measure the vertical distance between the front edge of the pivot door and the torsion box structure at the point marked in step (4). If the value is less or equal than 1.5 mm (0.059") above or below flush, get the value and go to step (12). Refer to DET. B of Figure 501.

Stow/Transit Microswitch Functional Test (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Get access to the applicable Stow/Transit switch. Do a visual check on the microswitches for physical damage.and do the actuator switch wear measure as follows: (a) Use a micrometer to measure the actuator switch diameter. Record this as dimension Y (Figure 501): 1 If the Y dimension is less than 7.9 mm (0.31 in), replace the applicable stow/transit switch (AMM MPP 78-34-01/400). 2 If the Y dimension is more than 7.9 mm (0.31 in), continue with stow/transit microswitch functional test. (2) Refer to table 502 to know which pin you must monitor in each step (WM 78-31-52) and (WM 78-31-53).
