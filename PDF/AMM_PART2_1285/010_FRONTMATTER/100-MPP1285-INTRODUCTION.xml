			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Introduction 1. General A. The Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) has been prepared in accordance with Air Transport Association of America (ATA) Specification No. 100 - Revision 33. B. It contains information required to service, functionally check, and repair all systems and equipment installed on the aircraft and normally requiring such actions on the line or in the maintenance hangar. C. The Aircraft Maintenance Manual also contains information on inspection and maintenance of aircraft structure; however, full information on repair to the aircraft structure is contained in the Structural Repair Manual. The tasks required by the Scheduled Maintenance Requirement Document (SMRD) are marked with a diamond in the table that lists the tasks described in each specific chapter. D. Although the AMM as a whole is not submitted to Authority for approval, there are EZAP-derived EWIS ICA-approved tasks in the AMM. These tasks are properly identified as follows: (1) In the task General pretopic, with one of these paragraphs: • This procedure is related to the EWIS ICA requirement. • This procedure is related to the Fuel Tanks Safety and EWIS ICA requirements. (2) EWIS Source Document: (a) The source document consists of a single document which provides references to EZAP-derived EWIS ICA data contained in the maintenance manuals. (b) This document also presents a cross-reference table between Maintenance Plan requirements and AMM procedures. (c) The Source Document is a technical report which can be accessed through Flyembraer web page: 1 Maintenance Plan &gt; ERJ145 &gt; Source Document E. Shop level maintenance information is contained in either the component maintenance manual or the vendor overhaul manual. F. If you are using this basic manual and a supplementary manual, you may find the same task in both manuals. In case of conflict between this basic manual and the supplementary manual, the supplementary manual must prevail. G.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Table 2 (Continued) Introduction Structure Group Chapters 51 to 57 Powerplant Group Chapters 71 to 80 (2) The chapter numbering system has provided a functional breakdown of the entire aircraft. It uses a three-element number, the elements being separated by dashes. Each element contains two digits, corresponding to Chapter/System, Section/Subsystem and Subject/Unit, as follows: Table 3 XX XX XX Chapter/System Section/Subsystem Subject/Unit (3) The first pair of digits is assigned by ATA-100 and designates the Chapter/System. For example: 21-XX-XX identifies the Air Conditioning System. (4) The second pair of digits designates the Section/Subsystem, only the first digit being assigned by ATA-100. When the second pair is -00-, it indicates that the matter is treated in general and applies to the Chapter/System as a whole. The second digit of the pair is used when it is convenient to break down the Section/Subsystem. For example: 21-20-XX - Identifies the Air Conditioning Distribution Subsystem. 21-24-XX - Identifies the Air Conditioning Distribution Recirculation Subsystem. (5) The third pair of digits designates a component or functions of chapters and sections covered by the previous elements. When the third pair is -00-, it indicates that the matter is dealt with in general and applies to the section as a whole, without treating of specific subjects concerning components or functions. For example: 21-24-01 - Identifies the Recirculation Fan of the Air Conditioning Distribution Recirculation Subsystem.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Table 7 (Continued) 842 Follow-on Procedures (To Restore to Normal) (d) The 5th element is a three-digit number used to create unique numbers for all tasks or subtasks which are similarly numbered through the first four elements. The 5th element is composed as follows: 1 The digits indicate the sequential order of creation for tasks (range 801 to 999)/ subtasks (range 001 thru 799) with the same function code within a subject. Example: • 71-00-00-500-803 - task 3 of subject 71-00-00; • 28-10-00-220-002 - subtask 2 of subject 28-10-00. NOTE: Whenever the numerical sequence of the tasks is not continuous (e.g.: task 71-00-00-700-802 is presented but task 71-00-00-700-801 is not), it means that the skipped tasks have been deleted or they do not belong to the set of the manuals covering your aircraft configuration. (e) The 6th element is a configuration identifier for tasks/subtasks. 1 For the tasks, the element consists of one-digit alphabetical identifier (A to Y, except I and O). The letter A indicates ALL. 2 For subtasks, the element consists of a three-digit alphanumeric identifier. The first digit is the same configuration letter as the task; the last two digits form a sequential number (01 to 99) assigned to the subtask at its creation. The code A00 indicates ALL.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: • IF A LANDING GEAR EMERGENCY EXTENSION HAS OCCURRED, IMMEDIATELY ACCOMPLISH THE MAINTENANCE CHECK DESCRIBED IN SECTION 5-50-13 OF THE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL BEFORE INSTALLATION OF LANDING GEAR SAFETY PINS. THE CAUTIONS AND WARNINGS DESCRIBED IN AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL MUST BE THOROUGHLY OBSERVED. NO PERSON SHALL BE ALLOWED INTO THE NOSE LANDING GEAR COMPARTMENT BEFORE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THESE ACTIONS. • APPLICABLE TO AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD. SB 145-32-0036.  ACCESS OF ANY PERSON TO THE NOSE LANDING GEAR COMPARTMENT, FOR ANY REASON, AFTER A MAINTENANCE ACTION IN THE LANDING GEAR EXTENSION/RETRACTION AND CONTROL SUBSYSTEM, IS TO BE ALLOWED ONLY WITH HYDRAULIC SYSTEM No. 1 UNPRESSURIZED (I.E. ENGINE No. 1 NOT RUNNING AND ELECTRICAL MOTOR-DRIVEN PUMP No. 1 TURNED OFF). • APPLICABLE TO AIRCRAFT POST-MOD. SB 145-32-0036.  ACCESS OF ANY PERSON TO THE NOSE LANDING GEAR COMPARTMENT IS ALLOWED ONLY AFTER THE SAFETY PIN OF THE NLG DOORS SOLENOID VALVE IS INSTALLED (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (2) In the maintenance procedures, the following should be considered: 1. EICAS Messages - It is assumed as known that the EICAS Messages blink until one of the MASTER CAUTION lights is pressed, when the messages stop blinking. 2. The expression "hydraulic lines" is used in this manual to mean the path run by the hydraulic fluid/pressure. Whenever the physical conduit is referred to, the word "tube" is employed.  E.g.: 1) "Bleed the hydraulic lines". It means removing the air bubbles from the hydraulic system as a whole.  E.g.: 2) "Remove the hydraulic tube from the valve". It means releasing the pipe (physically) from the valve. 3. Whenever it is informed that a given circuit breaker is located "on the circuit breaker panel", the circuit breaker panel installed overhead in the cockpit is being referred to. If a circuit breaker is located elsewhere, it will be explained as appropriate. 4. Whenever it is indicated in the AMM that a task should be done "as applicable" this means that only one task should be done. If you find two or more AMM tasks in the manual, do the task whose effectivity corresponds to your aircraft configuration. On the other hand, if the AMM is omitting one or more tasks, it means that this (these) task (s) is (are) not applicable to your aircraft configuration.  E.g.: Do a check of the rudder II deflections (TASK27-20-00-700-801-A) or (TASK 27-20-00-700-802-A) as applicable. 5. Whenever the AMM requires the accomplishment of a DC-voltage measurement and the expected result is 24 or 28 volts, any value between 22 and 29 volts is acceptable, unless otherwise stated in the task being carried out. 6. Whenever handling electrostatic discharge (ESD) susceptible equipment, refer to TASK 20-40-00-910-801-A for the correct safety procedures.

If there are two or more tasks, you must do the task whose effectivity corresponds to your aircraft configuration.
