			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Use personal protection equipment while you do the tasks. (2) All related persons must know the solvent handling procedures. (3) Do the task in an area with a good flow of air, where solvent vapors cannot collect and with no pieces of equipment which can make flames or sparks. (4) A fire extinguisher with a minimum of 25 kg of carbon dioxide or equivalent must be available. J. Placard Replacement SUBTASK 340-002-A WARNING: • ALWAYS USE EYE PROTECTION, RESPIRATOR, AND RUBBER GLOVES FOR PROTECTION FROM EPOXY, ADHESIVES, AND BOND AGENTS. • WHEN YOU USE METHYL-ETHYL-KETONE, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN PREPARATION. CAUTION: • BE CAREFUL TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE PLACARD ATTACHMENT SURFACE WHEN PLACARD IS REMOVED. • PROTECT ACRYLIC AND OTHER PLASTIC TRANSPARENCIES NOT TO PERMIT METHYL-ETHYL-KETONE TO TOUCH THEM, BECAUSE THIS SOLVENT CAUSES DAMAGE TO THOSE MATERIALS. (1) Remove the damaged placard as follows: (a) Adhesive Polyester Decal removal. 1 Insert a blade under the decal edge and carefully remove the decal. 2 When necessary, use heated vapor under the decal to make its removal easier. 3 If the removal continues not to be easy, mask the area around the decal, wipe the area with a cloth made moist with methyl-ethyl-ketone or trichloroethylene, and sand until the decal is removed. (b) Anodized Aluminum Nameplates and Acrylic Placard. 1 Insert a blade under the decal edge and carefully remove the decal. (2) Install the new placard in the same location where the removed placard was. Refer to AMM TASK 20-12-01-930-801-A/200 to apply and bond placard on the aircraft surfaces.
