			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 76-12-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. WOW INPUT SIGNAL TO FADEC - OPERATIONAL CHECK A. General (1) To access the FADEC discrete label, obey the instructions below: (a) For aircraft with -009 CMC, use Data Acquisition Software (DAS) GSE 211 or GSE 331 or GSE 505 or GSE 535. (b) For aircraft with -010 CMC, use Data Acquisition Software (DAS) GSE 263 or GSE 331 or GSE 505 or GSE 535. (c) For aircraft with -011 CMC, use Data Acquisition Software (DAS) GSE 331 or GSE 505 or GSE 535. (d) For aircraft with -012 CMC, use Data Acquisition Software (DAS) GSE 505 or GSE 535. (e) For aircraft with -013 CMC, use Data Acquisition Software (DAS) GSE 535, which is compatible with all the CMC versions available. (2) Do this check with the aircraft on the ground, not on jacks. (3) It is not necessary to operate the engines. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL E. Auxiliary Items Not Applicable F. Consumable Materials Not Applicable G. Expandable Parts Not Applicable H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Cockpit I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Energize the aircraft with the DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/ 200). WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE SAFETY PINS OF THE LANDING GEARS ARE INSTALLED ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (3) Make sure that the AIR/GROUND system is serviceable. (4) Set the thrust lever to the IDLE position. (5) Open access door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (6) Make sure that the CMC system is serviceable. (7) Connect the Personal Computer (GSE 130) to the CMC maintenance connector, with the Interconnect Cable (GSE 134). (8) On the circuit breakers panel, make sure that the AIR/GND A, B, C and D circuit breakers are closed. (9) (For Data Acquisition Software - GSE 211 or GSE 263) On the DAS menu, select "DOWNLOAD", then select FADEC 1A. (10) (For Data Acquisition Software - GSE 331 or GSE 505 or GSE 535) On the DAS menu, select the "FADEC LABELS" icon, then select FADEC 1A. (11) Select DISCRET LABEL. (12) Select the LABEL 350 (TDSWRD) to see the status of the WOW. (a) The status of the WOW must be 1 (=GND). (13) Check the status of the WOW for FADEC 2A, 1B and 2B. (a) The status of the WOW must be 1 (=GND). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 76-12-00 Page 3 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (14) On the circuit breakers panel, open the AIR/GND A, B, C and D circuit breakers. (15) Select FADEC 1A, LABEL 350. (a) The status of the WOW must be zero (=AIR). (16) Check the status of the WOW for FADEC 2A, 1B and 2B. (a) The status of the WOW must be zero (=AIR). (17) On the circuit breakers panel, close the AIR/GND A, B, C and D circuit breakers. (18) Select FADEC 1A, LABEL 350. (a) The status of the WOW must be 1 (=GND). (19) Check the status of the WOW for FADEC 2A, 1B and 2B. (a) The status of the WOW must be 1 (=GND). J. Operationally Check WOW Input Signal to FADEC (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do the operational check of the WOW input signal to FADEC 1A and 2A as follows: (a) On the DAS, select FADEC 1A. (b) Select DISCRETE LABEL. (c) Select the LABEL 264 (AIDIF1). (d) On the circuit breakers panel, make sure that the AIR/GND A, B, C, and D circuit breakers are closed. Result:  1 The status of the WOWDF must be zero (= no disagreement between FADEC input signals). (e) Open the AIR/GND A and C circuit breakers and wait approximately 20 seconds. Result:  1 The status of the WOWDF changes to 1 (= disagreement between FADEC input signals). (f) Close the AIR/GND A circuit breaker. Reset the FADECs and wait approximately 20 seconds. Result:  1 The status of the WOWDF changes to zero. (g) Open the AIR/GND A circuit breaker and wait approximately 20 seconds. Result:  1 The status of the WOWDF changes to 1. (h) Close the AIR/GND C circuit breaker. Reset the FADECs and wait approximately 20 seconds. Result:  1 The status of the WOWDF changes to zero.
