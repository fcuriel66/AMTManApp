			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE LANDING GEAR SAFETY PINS ARE INSTALLED TO PREVENT INJURIES TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (a) Remove fuel shutoff valve access panels 155DZ/155EZ and/or 156DZ/156EZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (4) Open hydraulic shutoff valve access panels 193JR and/or 193FL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (5) Remove engine bleed valve access panels 414DB and/or 424DB ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (6) Remove the electrical connector from the engine bleed valve, and connect a 28 V DC lamp to pins (A) and (B) of the wire bundle connector (WM 36-11-50/WM 36-11-51). (7) Remove engine anti-ice valve access panels 412AT and/or 422AT ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (8) Remove the electrical connector from the engine anti-ice valve, and connect a 28 V DC lamp to pins (A) and (C) of the wire bundle connector (WM 30-20-50/WM 30-20-51). J. Operationally Check Emergency Shutdown System (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  (Figure 504)  (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: • MAKE SURE THAT THE CIRCUIT BREAKERS OF THE FIRE EXTINGUISHING BOTTLE ARE OPEN. THIS WILL PREVENT AN ACCIDENTAL BOTTLE DISCHARGE. • BEFORE YOU OPEN THE N2 CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL, MAKE SURE THAT THE SENSORS PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA, PITOT 3, AND PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET TO OFF. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE CIRCUIT BREAKERS RELATED TO THE POWERPLANT N2 SIGNAL ARE OPEN. THIS WILL REMOVE THE SIGNAL TO CLOSE THE ANTI- ICE VALVE WITH THE ENGINE STOPPED. NOTE: This check is the same for the LH and RH engines. Set the engine anti-ice and engine bleed valves correctly (LH or RH) to the related system side to be examined. (1) Energize the aircraft. Refer to AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200. (a) Set the ice detection OVERRIDE switch to the "ENG" position. Push ENG AIR INLET pushbuttons 1 or 2 to send the open signal to the engine anti-icing valve. Result: 1 The striped bar at the pushbutton goes off. 2 The 28 V DC lamp, on the wire bundle connector of the engine anti-ice valve, goes off. This shows that a signal was sent to open the anti-ice valve. (b) Push BLEED pushbuttons 1 or 2 to send the open signal to the engine bleed valve.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 The striped bar at the pushbutton goes off. 2 The 28 V DC lamp, on the wire bundle connector of the engine bleed valve, will come on. This shows that a signal was sent to open the bleed valve. (c) Pull the emergency shutdown handle and make sure that: Result: 1 The advisory messages “E1(2) FUELSOV CLSD” and “E1(2) HYDSOV CLSD” are shown on the EICAS. 2 The 28 V DC lamp, on the wire bundle connector of the engine anti-ice valve, comes on. This shows that a signal was sent to close the anti-ice valve. 3 The 28 V DC lamp, on the wire bundle connector of the engine bleed valve, goes off. This shows that a signal was sent to close the bleed valve. 4 Make sure that the position indicator at the hydraulic shutoff valve and fuel shutoff valve shows “CLOSED” position. (d) Move the emergency shutdown handle back to the usual position and examine that: Result: 1 The advisory messages “E1(2) FUELSOV CLSD” and “E1(2) HYDSOV CLSD” go out of view from the EICAS display. 2 The 28 V DC lamp, on the wire bundle connector of the engine anti-ice valve, goes off. This shows that a signal was sent to open the anti-ice valve. 3 The 28 V DC lamp, on the wire bundle connector of the engine bleed valve, comes on. This shows that a signal was sent to open the bleed valve. 4 Make sure that the position indicator, at the hydraulic shutoff valve and the fuel shutoff valve, shows “OPEN” position. (2) Set the ice detection OVERRIDE switch back to the AUTO position. Push the ENG AIR INLET and BLEED pushbuttons to set them back to off. (3) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Disconnect the 28 V DC lamp from pins (A) and (C), on the wire bundle connector, and install the electrical connector to the engine anti-ice valve. (2) Install engine anti-ice valve access panels 412AT and/or 422AT ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (3) Disconnect the 28 V DC lamp from pins (A) and (B), on the wire bundle connector, and install the electrical connector to the engine bleed valve. (4) Install engine bleed valve access panels 414DB and/or 424DB ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). (5) Close hydraulic shutoff valve access panels 193JR and/or 193FL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100).
