			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that these circuit breakers are in the closed position: • AIR/GND A. • AIR/GND C. • N2 SIGNAL 1A. • N2 SIGNAL 1B. • N2 SIGNAL 2A. • N2 SIGNAL 2B. (5) Stop the stall protection system (SPS) as follows: (a) On the SPS panel, lift the guard and push the CUTOUT 1 (2) pushbutton. Result: 1 The striped bars of the pushbutton come on. 2 The warning message SPS1-2 INOP comes into view on the EICAS display. 3 The warning lights flash. 4 The aural warning (bell) operates. NOTE: Push one of the warning light switches to stop the lights and the aural warning. J. Operational Check of Idle Lockout (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do the operational check of the idle lockout microswitch and solenoid on the LH engine as follows: WARNING: • BEFORE YOU OPEN THE N2 CIRCUIT BREAKERS, MAKE SURE THAT SENSORS PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, AND PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET AT OFF. THIS WILL PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL. • DO NOT APPLY HYDRAULIC POWER TO THE AIRCRAFT, AND DO NOT OPERATE THE THRUST REVERSER WHILE THE MAINTENANCE PERSONS ARE AT WORK. (a) On the circuit breaker panel, set these circuit breakers to these positions: • AIR/GND A - Close. • N2 SIGNAL 1A - Open. • N2 SIGNAL 1B - Close. Result: 1 The thrust lever does not move below the IDLE position. (b) On the circuit breaker panel, set these circuit breakers as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 76-13-03 Page 3 of 13 Rev 52 - Apr 28/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Remove access panels 223SZ and 223RZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (2) Remove the control stand mask ( AMM TASK 76-11-05-000-801-A/400). (3) Remove the aileron-disconnect indication light from panel 223NZ, but do not disconnect the electrical connector ( AMM TASK 76-11-01-000-801-A/400). (4) NOTE: To do the step that follows, loosen the aileron-disconnect indication-light harness through access panel 223RZ. Move access panel 223NZ to the right side of the control pedestal ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (5) Remove the speed-brake command lever (AMM TASK 27-63-03-000-801-A/400). (6) Remove the elevator-disconnect indication light from panel 223OZ, but do not disconnect the electrical connector ( AMM TASK 76-11-01-000-801-A/400).

Adjustment Procedures (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 820-002-A (1) Adjust the idle lock microswitch as follows: (a) Install a multimeter to terminals "C" and "NC" of the idle lock microswitch, and make sure that there is continuity. Result: 1 There must be continuity across these terminals of the microswitch. (b) Apply 28 V DC to pins A (positive) and B (ground) of the connector of the idle lock solenoid. This will unlock the solenoid and actuate the microswitch. Result: 1 There must not be continuity across terminals "C" and "NC" of the microswitch. (2) If continuity continues, do these steps: • Release the nuts (8) and screws (4) that attach the idle lock microswitch (5) to the idle lock quadrant (7). • With the idle lock solenoid energized, push the microswitch until the contacts open and the continuity stops.
