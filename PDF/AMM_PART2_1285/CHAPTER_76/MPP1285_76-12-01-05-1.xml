			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL THRUST LEVER RESOLVER - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures for the thrust-lever-resolver functional check and adjustment. B. The thrust lever resolver is installed in the control stand assembly. C. These procedures are applicable to the LH and RH thrust-lever resolvers. D. Each resolver has two coils, one for each FADEC. Each coil sends information to its related FADEC (A and B), in the same engine. E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).
