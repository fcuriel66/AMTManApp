			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL THRUST LEVER MICROSWITCH - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do the functional check and adjustment of the thrust-lever microswitch assembly. B. The thrust-lever microswitch assemblies are installed in the control stand assembly. Each thrust lever (engines 1 and 2) has an assembly with eight microswitches (C1 through C8 from the actuating shaft). C. The procedures below are applicable to the LH and RH thrust-lever microswitch assemblies. D. To do these tasks, the aircraft must be in the ground configuration. E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Functional Check (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A CAUTION: • BEFORE YOU DISCONNECT OR CONNECT A COMPONENT THAT INTERFACES WITH THE FADEC, YOU MUST OPEN THE RELATED FADEC CIRCUIT BREAKERS. • AFTER A FADEC CHANGE OR REPROGRAMMING, OR AN ENGINE CHANGE, YOU MUST OPEN/CLOSE THE FADEC CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND RESET THE FADECs TWO TIMES. (1) Do the functional check of the thrust-lever microswitch assembly as follows: (2) Through the interconnection cable (GSE 134), connect, to the maintenance panel, the lap-top (GSE 130) with the DAS software installed. (3) (For Data Acquisition Software - GSE 211 or GSE 263) On the DAS menu, select "DOWNLOAD", then select the applicable FADEC. (4) (For Data Acquisition Software - GSE 331 or GSE 505 or GSE 535) On the DAS menu, select the "FADEC LABELS" icon, then select the applicable FADEC. (5) Select "ANALOG" and the TLA must be read on the screen, in the TLA area. NOTE: To do the check of the TL1 angle (thrust-lever left side), set the lap-top to FADEC 1A or 1B. To do the check of the TL2 angle (thrust-lever right side), set the lap-top to FADEC 2A or 2B. (6) Make sure that the gust lock lever is unlocked. (7) Disconnect connectors P1269 and P1270 from the control pedestal. (8) Connect the Control-Stand Microswitches Test Set (GSE 186) as follows: (a) Install test set connector P1 to connector J1269 on the control pedestal. This will permit the energization of the test set box. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 76-11-06 Page 4 of 17 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Install test set connector J1269 to connector P1269 of the control stand assembly. (c) Install test set connector J1270 to connector P1270 of the control stand assembly. (9) Set the GSE 186 test set switch to "ON". (10) Make sure that the both thrust levers are in IDLE position. (11) Move the applicable thrust lever in the TL MODE (first to FWD direction then to RWD direction). Refer to the microswitch set points shown in the tables below. Make sure that the lights change their status (ON or OFF) in the correct set point angle. NOTE: • During the test, GSE 186 LEDs related to Left Thrust Lever Microswitch Assy NÃÂ°3 has an inverse function from the Right Thrust Lever Microswitch Assy NÃÂ°3. Make sure that you are using the correct table during the test. Also for the LH TL, read the LEDs of ENG 1, and for RH TL, read the LEDs of ENG 2. • The lights must change their status to ON or OFF as shown in the table when the thrust lever goes through the set point. The lights must stay in this status until the related thrust lever comes to the end of its travel in the same TL MODE (FWD or RWD). • During the test and the thrust-lever angle value adjustment, keep the thrust lever of the opposite side in "idle".

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (18) Turn screw "A" in the counterclockwise (CCW) direction until screw "B" starts to turn and the related lights change their status. The lights must be in the correct status as shown in the tables. (a) If the screws become difficult to move, turn them to the other side. (19) Turn screw "B" in the clockwise (CW) direction until the microswitch contacts close. NOTE: Do not torque the lock screws at this moment. (20) Make sure the adjustment is correct. (21) Move the thrust lever in the TL mode direction (FWD or RWD). Refer to the microswitch set points shown in the table. Make sure that the lights change their status (ON or OFF) in the correct set point angle. NOTE: • The lights must change their status to ON or OFF as shown in the table when the thrust lever goes through the set point. The lights must stay in this status until the related thrust lever comes to the end of its travel in the same TL MODE (FWD or RWD). • During the test and the thrust lever angle adjustment, keep the thrust lever of the opposite side in "idle". (22) If the lights change their status during this travel, put the thrust lever in the position where it occurs and adjust screw "B" until the indicating lights go back to the previous adjustment. (23) Tighten the lock screws on the two sides of the microswitches. (24) Make sure that the indicating lights change their status in their related check points. Adjust and lock the microswitches again, if necessary. (25) Get out of the DAS program and turn off the lap-top. (26) Disconnect, from the maintenance panel, the interconnection cable (GSE 134) and the lap-top (GSE 130). (27) Disconnect the Control-Stand Microswitches Test Set (GSE 186), and connect electrical connectors P1269 and P1270 to the control pedestal. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Install the electrical connector of the elevator disconnect light. (3) Install control-pedestal access panel 223NZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (4) Install the speed-brake command lever (AMM TASK 27-63-03-400-801-A/400). (5) Install the electrical connector of the aileron disconnect light. (6) Install control-pedestal access panel 223OZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100).
