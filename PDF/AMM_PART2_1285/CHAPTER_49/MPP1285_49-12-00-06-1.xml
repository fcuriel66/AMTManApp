Tighten and/or replace as necessary. (2) Examine all metal parts for cracks, excessive nicks, gouges, or scratches. Replace the defective parts as necessary. (3) Examine the elastomers for attack by oil or other fluids as shown by a swollen or too soft elastomer. (4) Examine each elastomeric mount for contamination. If applicable, clean with a dry, lint- free cloth. (5) Examine the elastomers for loss of flexibility, which would cause loss of resilience. Replace all defective parts as necessary. CAUTION: • THE LIMITS IN STEPS (6) AND (7) BELOW MUST NOT BE EXCEEDED. IF NEAR-TO-LIMIT PARTS ARE FOUND, THEY MUST BE PERIODICALLY MONITORED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LIMITS ARE NOT EXCEEDED. • CRACKS, CUTS, AND BOND SEPARATION DEPTH MUST BE MEASURED WITH A SMALL SCALE (OR PIECE OF SHIM STOCK) PUT INTO THE CRACKS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. RELEASE ALL PRESSURE ON THE SCALE. READ THE DEPTH WITH NO FORCE OR PRESSURE ON THE SCALE. (6) Examine the elastomers for cuts or cracks which are deeper than 2.54 mm (0.10”). Replace the affected parts. (7) Examine the elastomer-metal bond separations which: • Are deeper than 2.54 mm (0.10”). • Are deeper than 1.52 mm (0.06”) and go approximately one third of the elastomer-metal interface. • Replace the affected parts.
