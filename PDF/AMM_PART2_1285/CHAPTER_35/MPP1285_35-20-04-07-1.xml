Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A WARNING: OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS BELOW BEFORE YOU REMOVE THE CREW OXYGEN MASK: • THE PERSONS WHO WILL DO THE PROCEDURE MUST OBEY THE SAFETY CONDITIONS GIVEN IN AMM TASK 35-10-00-910-801-A/200. • REFER TO AMM TASK 35-10-00-910-801-A/200 FOR THE GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO DO THE OXYGEN-SYSTEM SERVICING/ MAINTENANCE. (1) Remove the Passenger Oxygen Mask (AMM TASK 35-20-04-000-801-A/400). J. On-Wing Procedure to Clean the Passenger Oxygen Mask SUBTASK 110-003-A • WARNING: THE USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM BASE LUBRICANTS ON OXYGEN EQUIPMENT WILL CREATE A DANGEROUS FIRE HAZARD. • USE TRICHLOROETHANE IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA, AVOID PROLONGED INHALATION OF FUMES OR CONTACT WITH THE SKIN. CAUTION: • THE TRICHLOROETHANE MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO SOME PARTS. THEREFORE, USE THIS CLEANER ON METAL PARTS ONLY. • DO NOT USE ANY SOLUTIONS OR CONCENTRATIONS OTHER THAN THOSE SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED BY PURITAN-BENNETT AERO SYSTEMS CO. • DO NOT GET TRICHLOROETHANE OR CLEANER/DISINFECTANT CONCENTRATE ON SKIN, CLOTHING, OR IN EYES. USE PROTECTIVE GLOVES TO HANDLE CONCENTRATE AND SOLUTION. • USE ONLY THE RECOMMENDED CONCENTRATION IN NORMAL ROOM TEMPERATURE SOLUTION WITH CLEAN DISTILLED WATER. (1) The Oxygen Mask Assembly is part of an oxygen breathing supply system. Therefore, the following cleanliness requirements must be complied with. (a) The work area for cleaning, assembling, and testing must be clean and free of hydrocarbon residue, oil, or other petroleum base lubricants. (b) All instruments, tools, fixtures, test equipment and other materials which come into contact either directly or indirectly with the unit or its parts, should meet the requirements of paragraph (1) (a). (c) The pressurized gas or air supply used to dry parts after cleaning must be clean and free of hydrocarbon contamination and excessive moisture.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION:THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE VALVE BODY, ESPECIALLY THE VALVE SPRING, INLET CHECK VALVE AND EXHALATION VALVE DIAPHRAGM ARE VERY DELICATE AND SENSITIVE AND MUST BE HANDLED VERY GENTLY TO PREVENT DISTURBING THEIR INTEGRITY. (d) New or used parts must be cleaned in accordance with item (2) and (3) before assembling into the Oxygen Mask Assembly. (2) Clean all disassembled metal parts with the appropriate materials listed in paragraph F. Consumable Materials. (a) Submerge the disassembled metal parts in trichloroethane. (b) Move and agitate each metal part in the trichloroethane to allow the cleaning material to flush all internal and external surfaces. CAUTION: • DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CLEAN THE BAG ASSEMBLY. IF THE INSIDES OF THE BAG GET WET THEY WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DRY PROPERLY. • DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CLEAN THE FLOW INDICATOR INTERNALLY. ANY LIQUID REACHING THE INSIDE OF THE FLOW INDICATOR WOULD IMPAIR THE OPERATION. (c) Thoroughly dry each part, using gaseous nitrogen or commercially bottled, dry, clean compressed air. (3) Clean the plastic parts, new silicone rubber parts and combination material parts in a lukewarm detergent bath, not hotter than + 60ÃÂ°C (+ 140ÃÂ°F). (a) Prepare a cleaner/disinfectant and water solution. Use one ounce of Maxima 128 (see F. Consumable Materials) liquid concentrate per two and one-half gallons of water. Wear protective gloves. (b) Submerge and agitate the parts in the liquid. Allow the liquid to reach all parts including the delicate and very sensitive valve spring and elastomers. (c) Wipe the exteriors of the bag assembly, the flow indicator and the tube with a soft cotton cloth or gauze pad dipped into the prepared solution. (4) Thoroughly rinse the plastic parts, new silicone rubber parts and combination material parts in distilled water at room temperature. Allow parts to dry thoroughly at room temperature. (5) After the Oxygen Mask Assembly is thoroughly dry, seal it in a clean plastic bag. (6) If Inspection/Check (AMM TASK 35-20-04-200-801-A/600) will not be performed immediately store all parts in a suitable dry, dust free container. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Install the Passenger Oxygen Mask (AMM TASK 35-20-04-400-801-A/400).
