Discard Gaseous Oxygen Cylinder (Figure 201)  • WARNING: ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR FIRING PIN OF A OXYGEN CYLINDER NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE FIRING PIN FROM THE OXYGEN CYLINDER WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE CYLINDER IS EMPTY. • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKING) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. SUBTASK 960-002-A NOTE: Prepare a clean area and work surface before you start the maintenance procedures.
