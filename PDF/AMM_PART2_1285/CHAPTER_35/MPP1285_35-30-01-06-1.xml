			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 35-30-01-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. PRESSURE SHOWN ON THE PORTABLE OXYGEN CYLINDER GAUGE - INSPECTION/CHECK A. General (1) The function of this inspection is to make sure that the pressure shown on the gauge of the portable oxygen cylinder is correct. B. Zones and Accesses Not Applicable C. Tools and Equipment Not Applicable D. Auxiliary Items Not Applicable E. Consumable Materials Not Applicable F. Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task In the cockpit and passenger cabin H. Visual Check of Portable Oxygen Cylinder Gauge Pressure Indication (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 211-002-A WARNING: DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS CAN CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. (1) Use the graph (Figure 602) to get the related value between pressure and temperature. NOTE: The bottle reading in normal conditions of pressure and temperature, is 1800 psi at 21ÃÂ°C, the pressure gauge reading of the bottle may vary according to the adverse conditions of pressure and temperature. In this case you must use the chart (Figure 602) to the convert and establish the correct reading. (2) If the indicator is out of the red band, make sure that the values of pressure and temperature are in accordance with the graph (Figure 602). If not, remove the portable oxygen cylinder. Then, send it to the manufacturer's facilities or to a workshop authorized by the manufacturer. (3) Install a serviceable portable oxygen cylinder. NOTE: On aircraft equipped with portable oxygen cylinder installed under the rearmost passenger single seat, make sure that the mask stowage is outboard on the cylinder (on the sidewall side and not on the aisle side).
