General (1) This task gives the procedure to stow the passenger oxygen masks in the oxygen boxes. (2) The oxygen boxes are installed in the PSUs, lavatory, and flight-attendant station. (3) The passenger oxygen boxes are installed in zones 233, 234, 243, 244, 253, 254, 263, and 264. B. Zones and Accesses Not Applicable C. Tools and Equipment Not Applicable D. Auxiliary Items Not Applicable E. Consumable Materials Not Applicable F. Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task PSUs, lavatory, and flight-attendant station H. Passenger Oxygen Masks - Stowage (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 861-003-A WARNING: • ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF A GENERATOR NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE OXYGEN GENERATOR WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN. AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. THE EXTERNAL SURFACE WILL BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HOT TO BURN YOU. • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKING) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. (1) Put the reservoir bag (2) on a clean, flat surface and smooth out wrinkles. (2) Put the reservoir bag (2) in the facepiece (5) as follows. Refer to Figure 201: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 860-801-A/200 35-20-04 Page 2 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Put the headband (1) on the reservoir bag (2). (b) Fold the reservoir bag (2). NOTE: When the reservoir bag is correctly folded, you can easily see the mask part number on it. (c) Turn the reservoir bag (2) approximately 30 degrees and then push it into the facepiece (5). (d) Wind the supply tubing (4) counterclockwise into the facepiece (5). The flow indicator (3) must be the last part of the supply tubing (4) in the facepiece (5). (e) Hold the folded reservoir bag (2) and the supply tubing (4) in the facepiece (5) with the mask retainer (6). NOTE: Make sure that the flow indicator (3) stays inside the facepiece (5). (3) To close the doors (2) of the oxygen box (3), do as follows. Refer to Figure 202: NOTE: Before you close the door (2), make sure that the lanyards are correctly installed in the firing pin (8). Refer to figure 202, DET. C. (a) Put and hold the oxygen masks (6), (13) and (12) in the oxygen box as follows: 1 Put the first mask (6) in the oxygen box and hold it. NOTE: • This mask must be the farthest away from the generator outlets (11). • This mask must be put in the oxygen box with the facepiece (5) pointed to the doors (2). • Make sure that supply tubes (1) are between the bottom of the mask and the top of the box and are not between the mask and the wall of the box. • Be careful not to bend the supply tubing (1). This can cause malfunction. • Make sure that no excess hose is behind the mask. • Make sure that the oxygen mask has a loose fit in the mask cavity. 2 While you hold the first mask (6), install the second mask (13) (if applicable) in the oxygen box and hold them. NOTE: • This mask is installed in the middle of the oxygen box (3). • This mask must be put in the oxygen box with the facepiece (5) pointed to the doors (2). • Make sure that the supply tubes (1) are between the bottom of the mask and the top of the box and are not between the mask and the wall of the box.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Be careful not to bend the supply tubing (1). This can cause malfunction. • Make sure that no excess hose is behind the mask. • Make sure that the oxygen mask has a loose fit in the mask cavity. 3 While you hold the first mask (6) and the second mask (13), install the third mask (12) (if applicable) in the oxygen box and hold them all. NOTE: • This mask must be the closest to the generator outlets (11). • This mask must be put in the oxygen box with the facepiece (5) pointed to the doors (2). • Make sure that the supply tubes (1) are between the bottom of the mask and the top of the box and are not between the mask and the wall of the box. • Be careful not to bend the supply tubing (1). This can cause malfunction. • Make sure that no excess hose is behind the mask. • Make sure that the oxygen mask has a loose fit in the mask cavity. (b) Do a check to make sure that all masks can move freely. NOTE: The mask must move freely not to let them be stuck during the deployment. (c) Pull the latch reset lever (10) to set the electrical latch (9).Refer to figure 202, DET. B. (d) Put the lanyard (4) in the lanyard separator (7). Refer to figure 202, DET. B.
