			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Open the “PASS OXY DEPLOY 1” and “PASS OXY DEPLOY 2” circuit breakers. (b) Connect the test hose to the suction port of the anemometric bench and to the altitude sensing switch port. (c) Adjust the barometric scale on the anemometric bench to 1013 millibars. (d) On the anemometric bench, set the altitude (at a maximum climb rate of 500 ft/ min) until the display of the anemometric bench shows 15000 ft. NOTE: This procedure can cause interference with the local air traffic during simulations of altitude with the anemometric bench test. To prevent this, make sure that the transponder is on the STANDBY condition (AMM SDS 34-52-00/1).
