NOTE: • The data about the cylinder specification such as type, serial number and fabrication date are in a placard on the cylinder. • This topic is applicable to the crew oxygen cylinder and to the passenger oxygen cylinder. (a) The oxygen must be kept away from flammable materials, specially oils, greases, and hydrocarbons or other substances which can cause or increase fire. (b) The cylinders must be kept on special strong platforms, always in the vertical position, to prevent accidental damage. (c) The cylinders must be kept in a closed area with protection against rain, excessive moisture, and direct sunlight. The ambient temperature must not be higher than 50ÃÂ°C (122ÃÂ°F). (d) The cylinders must not be kept near elevators, doors, and other heavy objects which can beat them or fall on them. (e) The cylinders must be kept with a pressure of 100 to 300 psi (690 to 2070 kPa). If a cylinder shows a pressure lower than 50 psi (345 kPa), refer to the manufacturer recommendations to do the procedure to remove contamination.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) If applicable, make sure that the cylinder pressure regulator is in the OPEN position. CAUTION: DO NOT PERMIT THE LEAK DETECTION COMPOUND TO GO INTO THE SYSTEM. (d) Apply Leak Tec Compound No. 160X to find small leaks. 1 Apply the compound to the area in which you think there is a leak (gauge line, distribution line, and fittings), and do a check for bubbles. 2 If there are fittings with leaks, do as follows: a Tighten the fittings with leak to their maximum torque (Table 201). b Replace the fittings if the leakage cannot be removed. 3 If no fitting is found with leak, but the leakage continues, do as follows: a Apply the compound to the outer side of the discharge indicator and do a check for bubbles. b If there are bubbles, replace the rupture disc installed in the cylinder pressure regulator (Relief line). 4 After the check for leaks, clean the area with a clean cloth which does not release lints. WARNING: ONLY USE PRODUCTS WITH THE CLEAR INDICATION THAT THEY CAN BE USED WITH OXYGEN. THIS IS SPECIALLY APPLICABLE TO THREAD SEALING COMPOUNDS. (e) If necessary, apply thread sealing compound MIL-T-5542 or Teflon tape A- A-58092 to make the tapered thread seal better (Figure 203). 1 Refer to the manufacturers recommendation to apply the sealing compound. a Apply the sealing only to the first three male screw-threads (when you count from the end of the thread). b Do not permit the compound to go into the tube or component. 2 Apply 1-ÃÂ½ to 2 turns of tape. Do not cover three threads at the end of the fitting (Figure 206).
