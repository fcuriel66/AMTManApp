			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 35-10-00-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ACFT MODEL(S) EMB-135 2. CREW OXYGEN SYSTEM PRESSURE - CHECK A. General (1) This procedure gives instructions to do the check of the pressure of the crew oxygen system. NOTE: On aircraft for 16 passengers, this procedure check only the pressure of the crew oxygen system, since its passenger oxygen system is the chemical type. (2) Only approved persons must do the maintenance tasks related to the oxygen system. B. References REFERENCE DESIGNATION AMM MPP 06-41-01/100 - AMM TASK 12-14-00-600-801-A/300 - C.

J. Check Crew Oxygen System Pressure (Figure 601)  (Figure 603)  SUBTASK 211-011-B (1) Do a check to make sure that there is the minimum necessary oxygen pressure to permit the aircraft for dispatch as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 CONFIG-2 35-10-00 Page 2 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) (Crew with Pilot, Copilot, and Observer) Read the oxygen pressure gauge to make sure that the minimum pressure is 1500 psi at 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F). For other temperatures, refer to the oxygen pressure correction on access door 124AR. (b) (Crew with Pilot and Copilot) Read the oxygen pressure gauge to make sure that the minimum pressure is 1100 psi at 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F). For other temperatures refer to the oxygen pressure correction on access door 124AR. NOTE: If the pressure is below the minimum value, fill the oxygen system (AMM TASK 12-14-00-600-801-A/300). (2) If the pressure is above the minimum necessary for the aircraft dispatch, find the number of pre-flight oxygen mask tests available as follows: (a) Read the oxygen pressure gauge at 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F) (for other temperature refer to the oxygen pressure correction in the access door 124AR). (b) Find the oxygen pressure on the Oxygen Consumption chart (Figure 603) and draw a perpendicular line from the oxygen pressure axis as far as the desired oxygen consumption line (for two or three crewmembers). (c) The crossing point shows the number of the additional pre-flight crew cycles available. K. Check Crew and Passenger Oxygen Pressure (Figure 602)  (Figure 603)  SUBTASK 211-012-A EFFECTIVITY: AIRCRAFT FOR 16 PASSENGERS (1) Read the oxygen pressure gauges to make sure that the minimum pressures to dispatch are: WARNING: FOR TEMPERATURES DIFFERENT OF 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F), REFER TO THE OXYGEN PRESSURE CORRECTION IN THE ACCESS DOOR 124AR. (a) Crew oxygen system: 1 For pilot, copilot and observer: 1500 psi at 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F). 2 For pilot and copilot: 1100 psi at 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F). (b) Passenger oxygen system: 1150 psi at 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F). NOTE: If the pressure is less than the minimum value, fill the oxygen system (AMM TASK 12-14-00-600-801-A/300). (2) If the crew oxygen pressure is above the minimum necessary for the aircraft dispatch, find the number of pre-flight oxygen mask tests available as follows: (a) Read the oxygen pressure gauge at 21ÃÂ°C (70ÃÂ°F) (for other temperature refer to the oxygen pressure correction in the access door 124AR). (b) Find the oxygen pressure on the Oxygen Consumption chart (Figure 603) and draw a perpendicular line from the oxygen pressure axis as far as the desired oxygen consumption line (for two or three crewmembers).
