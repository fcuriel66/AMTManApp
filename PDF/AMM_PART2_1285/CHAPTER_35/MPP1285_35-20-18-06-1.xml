Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Dispensing units installed in the lavatory. I. Visual Check of Gaseous Oxygen Cylinder (Figure 601)  • WARNING: ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR FIRING PIN OF A GASEOUS OXYGEN CYLINDER NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE FIRING PIN FROM THE GASEOUS OXYGEN CYLINDER WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE OXYGEN CYLINDER IS EMPTY. • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKING) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. SUBTASK 211-002-A NOTE: Prepare a clean area and work surface before you start the check. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 35-20-18 Page 2 of 4 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Get access to the gaseous oxygen cylinder through the doors of the oxygen dispensing units. (2) Do an inspection/check of the gaseous oxygen cylinder as follows: (a) The gaseous oxygen cylinder must be one which was not used before. (b) Examine the gaseous oxygen cylinder for signs of corrosion, dents, bulges or cracks. (c) The gaseous oxygen cylinder in a not-used condition, the green indicator cap and the firing pin being in place. The green plastic indicator cap over the safety plug that will rupture if the cylinder vents through the safety plug. If the indicator cap is missing from the safety plug, that indicates the cylinder may be empty and should not be used. A cylinder without the indicator cap on the safety plug must be discarded. (d) To replace the oxygen generator, refer to AMM TASK 35-20-18-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 35-20-18-400-801-A/400.
