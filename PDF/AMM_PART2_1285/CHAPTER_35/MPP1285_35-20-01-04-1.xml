			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Removal (Figure 401)  (Figure 402)  (Figure 403)  (Figure 404)  (Figure 405)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: • ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF A GENERATOR NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE OXYGEN GENERATOR CAUSES THE FLOW OF OXYGEN TO START AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. THE EXTERNAL SURFACE WILL BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HOT TO BURN YOU. • DO NOT USE OIL OR OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS CAN CAUSE DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKE) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. • AIRCRAFT WITH "PURITAN" PSU: PUT A SAFETY RING IN THE ACTUATOR HOLE. • AIRCRAFT WITH "C&amp;D" PSU: PUT A SAFETY PIN IN THE ACTUATOR HOLE. NOTE: Prepare a clean area and work surface before you start the maintenance practices. (1) Get access to the chemical oxygen generator (1) through the doors (2) of the oxygen dispensing unit (3). NOTE: Do not let that the oxygen mask falls down. If it occurs, the chemical oxygen generator starts and will not stop until it is empty. (2) Lock the activation of the chemical oxygen generator as follows: (a) Aircraft with "Puritan" PSU: Install a safety ring in the actuator hole. Refer to DET. C, Figure 401. (b) Aircraft with "C&amp;D" PSU: Install a safety pin in the actuator hole. Refer to DET. C, Figure 402. (3) Disconnect the chemical-oxygen-generator lanyard loops (4) from the passenger- mask-assembly snap hook (5). The snap hook (5) stays with the passenger mask assemblies (6). NOTE: Do not disconnect the lanyards (7) from the pull-pin connection (8) on the chemical oxygen generator (1). (4) Remove the heat shield as follows: (a) Aircraft with "PURITAN" PSU: Push the heat shield (9) at the teeth (10) until the holes in the heat shield (9) are clear of the teeth (10). Then pull rearward until the heat shield (9) is released. Refer to DET. A, Figure 401. (b) Aircraft with "C&amp;D" PSU: Pull the heat shield (9) until it is released. Refer to DET. A, Figure 402.
