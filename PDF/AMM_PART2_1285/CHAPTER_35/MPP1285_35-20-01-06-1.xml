			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Visual Check of Chemical Oxygen Generator (Figure 601)  (Figure 602)  WARNING: • ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF A GENERATOR NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE CHEMICAL OXYGEN GENERATOR WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. THE EXTERNAL SURFACE WILL BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HOT TO BURN YOUR SKIN. • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKING) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. SUBTASK 211-002-A NOTE: Prepare a clean area and work surface before you start the check. (1) Get access to the chemical oxygen generator through the doors of the oxygen dispensing units. (2) Do an inspection/check of the chemical oxygen generator as follows: (a) The chemical oxygen generator must be one which was not used before. (b) Examine the chemical oxygen generator for signs of corrosion, dents, bulges or cracks. (c) The chemical oxygen generator in a not-used condition, the expended indicator dot must be orange and the pull-pin installed in the actuator housing. If the area in the circle is totally black, it is a sign that the chemical oxygen generator was used and must be replaced. (d) To replace the chemical oxygen generator, refer to AMM TASK 35-20-01-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 35-20-01-400-801-A/400.
