			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • WARNING: ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF A GENERATOR NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE OXYGEN GENERATOR WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN. AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. THE EXTERNAL SURFACE WILL BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HOT TO BURN YOU. • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKING) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. CAUTION: • DO NOT CUT THE TUBING THAT SUPPLIES THE PASSENGER MASK ASSEMBLY. REPLACE THE PASSENGER OXYGEN-MASK ASSEMBLY. IF ITS SUPPLY TUBING WAS MADE SHORTER. • DO NOT PUSH OR PULL THE FITTING OF THE OXYGEN-GENERATOR OUTLET VALVE IF THE OUTLET VALVE IS NOT SAFELY HELD. (1) Get access to the passenger oxygen mask assembly (4) through the doors (3) of the oxygen dispensing units. Refer to Figure 401, DET. A. NOTE: • On the chemical oxygen generator actuator end, there is a dot indicator . Expended generator - when the dot is black or not expended generator - when the dot is orange. • The gaseous oxygen cylinder in a not-used condition, the green indicator cap and the pull pin being in place. If the indicator cap is missing from the safety plug, it shows that the cylinder can be empty and you must not use it. Discard the cylinder without the indicator cap on the safety plug. • If the generator is expended, remove it and install a new, not expended generator ( AMM TASK 35-20-01-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 35-20-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Tag and safety the oxygen generator (1) with safety pin (11). Refer to Figure 401, DET. D. (3) Disconnect the lanyards (6) from the facepiece lanyard ring (7). Refer to Figure 401, DET. C. (4) Remove the passenger oxygen mask assembly (4) from the mask retainer (5). Refer to Figure 401, DET. A. (5) Disconnect the supply tubing (2) from the oxygen generator (1). Refer to Figure 401, DET. E. (6) Remove the passenger oxygen-mask assembly (4). (7) Put a cover (9) on the generator outlet (10). Refer to Figure 401, DET. E.
