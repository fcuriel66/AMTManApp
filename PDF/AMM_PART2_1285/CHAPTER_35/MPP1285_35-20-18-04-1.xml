			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: • ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR FIRING PIN OF A GASEOUS OXYGEN CYLINDER NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE FIRING PIN FROM THE GASEOUS OXYGEN CYLINDER CAUSES THE FLOW OF OXYGEN TO START AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. • DO NOT USE OIL OR OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS CAN CAUSE DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKE) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. • PUT A SAFETY PIN IN THE ACTUATOR HOLE. NOTE: Prepare a clean area and work surface before you start the maintenance practices. (1) Get access to the gaseous oxygen cylinder (1) through the doors (2) of the oxygen dispensing unit (5). NOTE: Do not let that the oxygen mask falls down. If it occurs, the gaseous oxygen cylinder starts and will not stop until it is empty. (2) Lock the activation of the gaseous oxygen cylinder as follows: (a) Install a safety pin in the actuator hole. Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. (3) Disconnect the oxygen cylinder lanyard loops from the passenger-mask-assembly snap hook (4). The snap hook (4) stays with the passenger mask assemblies (6). NOTE: Do not disconnect the lanyards (9) from the firing pin connection (8) on the gaseous oxygen cylinder (1). (4) Loosen the oxygen cylinder clamp screw until the clamp (7) is fully open and the oxygen cylinder (1) can be removed. (5) Remove from the oxygen cylinder (1) the oxygen supply tubes (3) that supply the passenger mask assembly. (6) Carefully remove oxygen cylinder (1) from the oxygen dispensing units (5). NOTE: Be careful not to tangle the oxygen supply tubes (3) or the cylinder lanyards (9). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 35-20-18 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: • ON ITS INSTALLATION, MAKE SURE THAT DEVICES AGAINST ACCIDENTAL PULL ARE REMOVED FROM THE GASEOUS OXYGEN CYLINDER NOT TO PREVENT OPERATION. ONLY THE FIRING PIN MUST STAY IN THE ACTUATOR. • DO NOT CUT THE ACTUATOR SAFETY PIN. • ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR FIRING PIN OF A GASEOUS OXYGEN CYLINDER NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE FIRING PIN FROM THE GASEOUS OXYGEN CYLINDER CAUSES THE FLOW OF OXYGEN TO START AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS CAN CAUSE DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKE) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. NOTE: Prepare a clean area and work surface before you start the maintenance practices. NOTE: For the lavatory, do the gaseous oxygen cylinder installation procedure as follows: (1) Put the oxygen cylinder (1) into the cylinder cavity in the box assembly. (2) Turn the oxygen cylinder (1) until the identification nameplate of the cylinder points towards the door assemblies when they are closed (approximately 45ÃÂ°). Make sure that the firing pin ring points towards the same angle. (3) Close and attach the oxygen cylinder clamp (7). (4) Install to the oxygen cylinder (1) the oxygen supply tubes (3) that supply the passenger mask assembly. (5) Connect the oxygen-generator lanyard loops to the passenger-mask-assembly snap hook (4). (6) After you install the oxygen cylinder, do as follows: (a) Remove the safety pin in the actuator hole. Refer to DET. B, (Figure 401). (7) Stow the mask. Refer to TASK 35-20-01-860-801-A. (8) Close the doors (2) of the oxygen dispensing unit (5). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close these circuit breakers: • PASS OXY DEPLOY 1 (location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/MISCELLANEOUS).
