			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Removal (Figure 401)  (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 020-011-B WARNING: • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKING) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA. CAUTION:DO NOT CUT THE TUBING THAT SUPPLIES THE PASSENGER MASK ASSEMBLY. REPLACE THE PASSENGER OXYGEN-MASK ASSEMBLY. IF ITS SUPPLY TUBING WAS MADE SHORTER. (1) Get access to the passenger oxygen mask assembly (4) through the doors (3) of the oxygen dispensing units. Refer to Figure 401, DET. A. NOTE: • On the chemical oxygen generator actuator end, there is a dot indicator. Expended generator - when the dot is black or not expended generator - when the dot is orange. • The gaseous oxygen cylinder in a not-used condition, the green indicator cap and the pull pin being in place. If the indicator cap is missing from the safety plug, it shows that the cylinder can be empty and you must not use it. Discard the cylinder without the indicator cap on the safety plug. • If the generator is expended, remove it and install a new, not expended, generator ( AMM TASK 35-20-01-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 35-20-01-400-801-A/400). (a) Do the removal of the passenger oxygen-mask assembly as follows: 1 Tag and safety the oxygen generator (1) with safety pin (11). Refer to Figure 401, DET. D. WARNING: ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF A GENERATOR NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE OXYGEN GENERATOR WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN. AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. THE EXTERNAL SURFACE WILL BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HOT TO BURN YOU. CAUTION:DO NOT PUSH OR PULL THE FITTING OF THE OXYGEN- GENERATOR OUTLET VALVE IF THE OUTLET VALVE IS NOT SAFELY HELD. 2 Disconnect the lanyards (6) from the facepiece lanyard ring (7). Refer to Figure 401, DET. C. 3 Remove the passenger oxygen mask assembly (4) from the mask retainer (5). Refer to Figure 401, DET. A. 4 Disconnect the supply tubing (2) from the oxygen generator (1).

(2) (AIRCRAFT FOR 16 PASSENGERS, Figure 402) Remove the passenger oxygen- mask assembly (1) as follows: (a) Open the door (2) to get access to the passenger oxygen-mask assembly (3). WARNING:ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF SHUTOFF VALVE. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE SHUTOFF VALVE WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN. (b) Disconnect the lanyards (7) from the facepiece lanyard clip (6). (c) Remove from the manifold assembly (8) the supply tubing (5) that supplies the passenger oxygen-mask assembly (3). (d) NOTE: On the tubing that supplies the mask, there is an indicator dot, which shows: • There is oxygen flow, when the dot is green; or • There is not oxygen flow, when the dot is orange. Remove the passenger oxygen-mask assembly (3). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 CONFIG-2 35-20-04 Page 4 of 10 Rev 49 - Feb  16/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: • DO NOT CUT THE TUBING THAT SUPPLIES THE PASSENGER MASK ASSEMBLY. REPLACE THE PASSENGER OXYGEN-MASK ASSEMBLY. IF ITS SUPPLY TUBING WAS MADE SHORTER. • DO NOT PERMIT THE TUBING THAT SUPPLIES THE PASSENGER MASK ASSEMBLY OR THE OXYGEN GENERATOR LANYARDS TO WEDGE OR BECOME ENTANGLED ON ANYTHING IN THE UNIT. THEY MUST BE FREE TO FALL OUT OF THE UNIT AS NECESSARY. (1) Install the passenger oxygen mask assembly as follows: (Figure 401) (a) Remove the cover (9) from the generator outlet (10). Refer to Figure 401, DET. E. (b) Connect the supply tubing (2) to the oxygen generator (1). Refer to Figure 401, DET. E. NOTE: Make sure that supply tubing has a minimum grip of 13 mm (0.5 in) with the generator outlet (10). WARNING:ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF A GENERATOR NOT USED. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE OXYGEN GENERATOR WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN. AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. THE EXTERNAL SURFACE WILL BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HOT TO BURN YOU. (c) Connect the lanyard (6) on the facepiece lanyard ring (7). Refer to Figure 401, DET. C. (d) Remove the safety pin (11) from the oxygen generator (1). Refer to Figure 401, DET. D. (e) Do the mask stowage ( AMM TASK 35-20-04-860-801-A/200). (2) (AIRCRAFT FOR 16 PASSENGERS, Figure 402) Install the passenger oxygen-mask assembly as follows: (a) Fold the passenger oxygen-mask assembly (3), refer to (Figure 403). 1 Fold the reservoir bag (8) into thirds. NOTE: When correctly folded, the legend can be easily seen. 2 Continue to fold the reservoir bag (8). Then push it into the facepiece (9) of the passenger oxygen-mask assembly on the top of the elastic head band (10). NOTE: When correctly folded, the mask part can be easily seen. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL NOT TO KINK THE TUBE IN THE FACEPIECE. 3 Wind the tubing (6) that supplies the passenger mask assembly clockwise into the facepiece (9), on the top of the folded reservoir bag (8). An approximate 50.8 mm (2 inch) outer diameter coil gets the best result. The flow indicator (11) must be the last part of the supply tubing in of the facepiece (9).
