			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 35-10-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. CREW OXYGEN MASK - OPERATIONAL CHECK A. General (1) This task gives the procedure to do the operational check of the crew oxygen mask. B. Zones and Accesses Not Applicable C. Tools and Equipment Not Applicable D. Auxiliary Items Not Applicable E. Consumable Materials Not Applicable F. Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE Cockpit (RH lateral console, LH lateral 1 Does the task console, and RH aft console) H. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the minimum oxygen pressure is 1052 psi. (2) Examine the crew oxygen mask for signs of damage, deformation, cracks, and deterioration. NOTE: If a repair is necessary, refer to the last revision of the CMM of the equipment. I. Operationally Check Crew Oxygen Masks WARNING: DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) (AIRCRAFT WITH "EROS" OXYGEN MASKS) Do the operational check as follows (Figure 501): NOTE: The stowage box of the observer mask does not contain the blinker, the ON- OFF valve, and the test/shut-off sliding control lever. (a) Push the test/shut-off sliding control lever of the stowage box of the oxygen mask of the pilot/copilot in the direction of the arrow.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 A white band, on the left lid face of the stowage box, comes into view. 2 The oxygen is supplied to the mask regulator assembly. 3 The blinker becomes yellow for a very short time and then becomes black again. This shows that the regulator has no leak. (b) Keep the test/shut-off sliding control lever pushed in and operate the “PRESS- TO-TEST” control knob of the regulator. Result: 1 The blinker becomes yellow and black again. (c) Release the test/shut-off sliding control lever. Result: 1 The white band, on the left lid face of the stowage box, goes out of view. 2 The test/shut-off sliding control lever goes back to the OFF position. (d) Remove the pilot's and copilot's oxygen mask from the stowage box, hold the mask, and keep the harness inflation control pushed in. Result: 1 The blinker becomes yellow, and then black again in seconds. This shows that the pneumatic harness has no leak in the inflation position. (e) Remove the observer oxygen mask from the stowage box, hold the mask, and keep the harness inflation control pushed in. Result: 1 The flow/pressure indicator installed on the flexible hose of the observer mask becomes transparent for a very short time and then becomes black again. This shows that the pneumatic harness has no leak in the inflation position. (f) Put on the pilot/copilot oxygen mask. Breathe with the regulator set at "N", then at the 100% position. Result: 1 In each case, monitor the breathing in the blinker. (g) Put on the observer oxygen mask. Breathe with the regulator set to "N", then to the 100% position. Result: 1 In each case, monitor the breathing on the flow/pressure indicator installed on the flexible hose of the observer mask. (h) Turn the control knob of the regulators of the mask to the EMERGENCY position. After some breathing cycles, cancel the emergency pressure. (i) Set the regulators of the mask to "N". (j) To do a test of the microphone of the crew oxygen mask, listen for noise through the communication set. (k) Turn the control knob of the regulators of the mask to the 100% position. (l) Put the masks in the stowage box. (2) (AIRCRAFT WITH "PURITAN" AND "B/E AEROSPACE" OXYGEN MASKS) Do the operational check as follows (Figure 502): EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 35-10-00 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: The stowage box of the observer mask does not contain the blinker, and the test/reset button. (a) Push the test/reset button of the stowage box of the pilot's and copilot's oxygen mask. Result: 1 An "Oxy On" flag, on the right door of the stowage box, comes into view. 2 The oxygen is supplied to the mask regulator assembly. 3 The blinker becomes yellow for a very short time and then becomes black again. This shows that the regulator has no leak. (b) Keep the test/reset button pushed in and operate the control knob of the regulator of the mask to the EMERGENCY position. Result: 1 The blinker becomes yellow and black again. (c) Release the test/reset button. Result: 1 The "Oxy On" flag, on the right door of the stowage box, goes out of view. (d) Remove the pilot's and copilot's oxygen mask from the stowage box, hold the mask, and push the red inflation button to inflate the harness assembly. Result: 1 The blinker becomes yellow and then black again in seconds. This shows that the pneumatic harness has no leak in the inflation position. (e) Remove the observer oxygen mask from the stowage box, hold the mask, and push the red button to inflate the harness assembly. Result: 1 The flow/pressure indicator, installed on the flexible hose of the observer mask must indicate green. This shows that there is pressure in the oxygen line if the flow/pressure indicator shows red there is not pressure in the oxygen line. There must be no audible leakage at the hose and connectors. (f) Put on the pilot's and copilot's oxygen mask. Breathe with the regulator set at "N", then at the 100% position. Result: 1 In each case, monitor the breathing in the blinker. (g) Put on the observer oxygen mask. Breathe with the regulator set to "N", then to the 100% position. Result: 1 In each case, monitor the breathing on the flow/pressure indicator installed on the flexible hose of the observer mask. (h) Turn the control knob of the regulators of the mask to the EMERGENCY position. After some breathing cycles, cancel the emergency pressure. (i) Set the regulators of the mask to "N". (j) To do a test of the microphone of the crew oxygen mask, listen for noise through the communication set.
