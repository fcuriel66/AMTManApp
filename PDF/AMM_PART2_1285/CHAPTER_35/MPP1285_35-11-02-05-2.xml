(i) Set the MFD display (RH or LH side) to the ECS/Ice system page (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1). (j) Release all the pressure from the line. Result:  1 The pressure (0 psi) is shown on the MFD display in red. (k) Pressurize the line with 250 psi of nitrogen. Result:  1 The pressure (250 psi) is shown on the MFD display in red. (l) Pressurize the line with 650 psi of nitrogen. Result:  1 The pressure (650 psi) is shown on the MFD display in amber. (m) Pressurize the line with 750 psi of nitrogen. Result:  1 The pressure (750 psi) is shown on the MFD display in amber. (n) Pressurize the line with 760 psi of nitrogen. Result:  1 The pressure (760 psi) is shown on the MFD display in green. (o) Pressurize the line with 1850 psi of nitrogen. Result:  1 The pressure (1850 psi) is shown on the MFD display in green. (p) Close the nitrogen source shutoff-valve. (q) Carefully disconnect the hose from the oxygen charging valve to release the line remaining pressure. (r) Remove the nitrogen source. (s) Disconnect the oxygen filling line from the tee installed in step (1).(e). (t) Connect the oxygen filling line to the cylinder pressure regulator and safety it.

(v) Open the cylinder-pressure regulator. K. Functional Check of the Pressure Transducer (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 720-015-A (1) Do the functional check as follows: (a) Remove access panel, 224PZ for aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-25-0072 or 224QZ for aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-25-0072 ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100) and get access to the oxygen cylinder. (b) Cut the lockwire and close the cylinder pressure regulator. (c) Cut the lockwire and disconnect the oxygen filling line from the cylinder pressure regulator. (d) Cut the lockwire, disconnect the capillary line (which supplies the pressure transducer with the cylinder pressure) from the cylinder pressure-regulator, and then from the related tee. NOTE: A small quantity of oxygen can flow out when you disconnect the oxygen filling line and the capillary line. (e) Connect the oxygen filling line removed in step (1).(c) to the tee, in the location where the capillary line was removed from. (f) Open access door 124AR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) and connect the nitrogen source to the oxygen charging valve. Make sure that there is no leakage. NOTE: When you pressurize the line or release the pressure from the line, always do it slowly. (g) Pressurize the line with 500 psi of nitrogen. Result:  1 On the EICAS display, the OXYGEN LO PRESS caution message goes out of view when the pressure is above 400 psi. (h) Release the pressure from the line. Result:  1 The EICAS display shows the OXYGEN LO PRESS caution message when the pressure is equal to or less than 400 psi. (i) Set the MFD display (RH or LH side) to the ECS/Ice system page (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1). (j) Release all the pressure from the line. Result:  1 The pressure (0 psi) is shown on the MFD display in red. (k) Pressurize the line with 240 psi of nitrogen. Result:  1 The pressure (240 psi) is shown on the MFD display in red.
