			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: THE SOLVENTS AND CLEANERS CONTAIN POISONOUS AGENTS. WEAR GLOVES WHEN YOU USE THEM AND DO NOT LET THEM TOUCH YOUR SKIN OR EYES. HAVE A SUFFICIENT FLOW OF AIR OR USE RESPIRATORS. NOTE: • If necessary, clean all tubings with no protection at their ends which were open to the air, and all parts to be installed. • After the cleaning operation, put the tubings and parts which you will not use in an approved container and keep them safety (AMM TASK 35-10-00-910-804- A/200). (1) Flush the parts with clean water for 3 to 5 minutes, or until all visible signs of contamination or oil are removed. Apply a strong water jet to the parts. NOTE: We recommend you to use one liter of perchloroethylene for each 100 grams of parts, and the replacement of all the liquid after you wash 1 Kg of parts. (2) Remove the grease from the parts with a bath of perchloroethylene for 5 minutes. Shake the liquid in order to remove the contamination. (3) Put the stainless-steel parts in a bath of nitric acid at a concentration of 61% for 2 hours to remove the contamination. (4) Flush the parts with clean water for 20 to 30 minutes. (5) Dry the parts. NOTE: Dry the stainless-steel parts in an oven at 90ÃÂ°C (194ÃÂ°F) to 100ÃÂ°C (212ÃÂ°F) for 1 hour. Apply nitrogen to the aluminum parts to dry them.
