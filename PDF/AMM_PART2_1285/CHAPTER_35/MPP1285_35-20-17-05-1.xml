			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-005-A (1) Make sure that the following circuit breakers are closed: • PASS OXY DEPLOY 1 (location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/MISCELLANEOUS). • PASS OXY DEPLOY 2 (location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2). (2) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Make sure that "HIGH ALT" is not activated on the Vertical Speed screen of the MFD (Figure 501). (4) Set the test knob of the dispensing units to “Test” (Figure 501). (5) Remove the Turning Backup Control Panel ( AMM TASK 23-81-02-000-801-A/400). (6) Remove the Auto Pilot Controller ( AMM TASK 22-11-02-000-801-A/400). (7) Make sure that the knob of the passenger oxygen control panel is in the AUTO position. (8) On the overhead panel, set the BATT 1 switch to OFF and make sure that the BATT 2 switch is set to OFF. NOTE: The switches of batteries 1 and 2 must be set to the OFF position to permit the external power to energize the electrical systems when the aircraft is in the AIR condition. (9) Make sure that the sensors (PITOT 1/TAT 1/AOA 1; PITOT 2/TAT 2/AOA 2; PITOT/ STATIC 3) pushbuttons, on the overhead panel, are set at OFF (lights ON) and attach a DO-NOT-TURN- AUTO tag to them. WARNING: IF THE SENSORS HTG CIRCUIT BREAKER IS OPENED, THE HEATING OF THE PILOT TUBES AND STATIC PORTS WILL BE ACTIVATED. (10) On the circuit breaker panel, on the cockpit ceiling, make sure that the SENSORS HTG circuit breaker is closed. J. Functionally Check Passenger Oxygen System in Auto Mode Figure 501  SUBTASK 720-003-A (1) Do the functional check as follows: (a) Open the “PASS OXY DEPLOY 1” and “PASS OXY DEPLOY 2” circuit breakers. (b) Connect the test hose to the suction port of the anemometric bench and to the altitude sensing switch port. (c) Adjust the barometric scale on the anemometric bench to 1013 millibars. (d) On the anemometric bench, set the altitude (at a maximum climb rate of 1000 ft/ min) until the display of the anemometric bench shows 16000 ft. NOTE: This procedure can cause interference with the local air traffic during simulations of altitude with the anemometric bench test.

Result: 1 The doors of the dispensing units must open. 2 The “NO SMOKING” light, in the passenger cabin, comes on. 3 The “FASTEN SEAT BELTS” light, in the passenger cabin, comes on. 4 The “ON” light, in the passenger oxygen control panel, comes on. 5 The "RETURN TO SEAT" light, in the lavatory, comes on. (h) Stop for 6 seconds after the doors of the dispensing units open. Then reset the manual lever of the latch and close the doors. (i) On the anemometric bench, set the altitude back to 10000 ft at a rate of descent of less than 1000 ft/min. (j) Set the knob of the passenger oxygen control to CLOSE then to AUTO. Result: 1 The “NO SMOKING” light, in the passenger cabin, goes off. 2 The “FASTEN SEAT BELTS” light, in the passenger cabin, goes off. 3 The “ON” light, on the passenger oxygen control panel, goes off. 4 The "RETURN TO SEAT" light, in the lavatory, goes off. (k) Push the bezel button to activate "HIGH ALT" on the Vertical Speed screen of the MFD (Figure 501). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the "HI ALT LDG-T/O" caution message (for aircraft with EICAS up to version 20.5) or advisory message (for aircraft with EICAS version 20.5 and on). (l) On the anemometric bench, set the altitude (at a maximum climb rate of 1000 ft/ min) until the display of the anemometric bench shows 16000 ft. Between 14000 and 15000 ft, the results below must occur. Result: 1 The doors of the dispensing units must open.
