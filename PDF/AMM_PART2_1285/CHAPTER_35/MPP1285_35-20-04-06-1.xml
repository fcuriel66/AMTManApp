Visually Check Passenger Oxygen Mask (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 211-007-B • WARNING: ALWAYS BE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY PULL THE LANYARDS OR PULL-PIN OF A GENERATOR. THE REMOVAL OF THE PULL-PIN FROM THE OXYGEN GENERATOR WILL START THE FLOW OF OXYGEN AND YOU CANNOT STOP IT UNTIL THE GENERATOR IS EMPTY. THE EXTERNAL SURFACE WILL BECOME SUFFICIENTLY HOT TO BURN YOU. • DO NOT USE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASE LUBRICANTS ON THE OXYGEN EQUIPMENT. THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS FIRE AND BAD INJURY TO PERSONS. • KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION (HOT EXHAUST, SPARKS, FLAMES, SMOKING) AWAY FROM THE OXYGEN SERVICING AREA.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Prepare a clean area and work surface before you start the check operation. (1) Get access to the passenger oxygen mask assembly (1) through the doors of the oxygen dispensing units doors (9). (2) Do the inspection/check of the passenger oxygen mask assembly (1) as follows: (a) Do a check for mechanical damage such as parts that are torn, broken, frayed, missing or have holes. (b) Examine all parts for changes in material properties, such as loss of flexibility, permanent deformation, or kinks. (c) Look for small tears in the kinked section or other region of the tube that supplies the passenger oxygen mask assembly (1). This can potentially tear over time and cause the flow of oxygen to decrease. NOTE: • Make sure that the supply tubing (8) is correctly installed. • If you find small tears, replace the oxygen mask assembly (1) AMM TASK 35-20-04-000-801-A/400. (d) Examine the lanyards (2) of the passenger oxygen mask assembly (1) for continuity and retention. NOTE: Make sure that the lanyard (2) length is 215.9 mm (8.5 in). (e) FOR AIRCRAFT WITH SNAP HOOK: Strongly pull the lanyards (2) near the snap hook (3) to make sure that the cord clamps are correctly crimped and will not let the lanyards (2) be removed. (f) Do a visual check for liquid (droplets) or solid (dirt) contamination on the internal and external surface of the bag and tube. (g) Examine the reservoir bag (7) of the passenger oxygen mask assembly (1) for tears. Specially examine the area where the bag is attached to the cone and valve assembly. (h) The head band (5) of the passenger oxygen mask assembly (1) must be clean and white with no signs of rough areas, tears, or too pulled sections. It must also be approved for normal extension and relaxation. (i) Make sure that de facepiece (6) is free from odor. (j) The bag and tube cannot be discolored. (k) Make sure that all flapper valves (4) are properly installed, aligned and undamaged. (l) Extend the supply tubing (8) straight from the reservoir bag (7) and make sure that the in-line flow indicator is properly oriented with the arrow on the flow indicator pointing to the reservoir bag (7).
