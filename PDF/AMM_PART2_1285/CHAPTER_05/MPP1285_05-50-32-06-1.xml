			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 05-50-32-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. OVERSTEERING - GENERAL VISUAL INSPECTION A. General (1) A NLG steering overtravel inspection is necessary when these conditions occur: (a) When you find the NLG shock strut steering overtravel target bracket damaged or cracked. (b) When you have an incorrect or accidental NLG shock strut steering operation. (2) The steering overtravel is an incorrect or accidental operation which turns the NLG shock strut wheels more than the maximum steering angle with the towbar attached. (3) When the NLG shock strut is turned more than the maximum steering angle with the towbar attached, damage to the NLG, NLG wheelwell and/or aircraft structure can occur. When this condition occurs, do an inspection for damage on some of the components. B.

(6) Remove the CIC and sealant from the components and areas where it can hinder the inspection or give incorrect results. J. NLG Shock Strut Steering Overtravel - General Visual Inspection Procedure SUBTASK 212-002-A (1) Refer to the flowchart on Figure 601 which brings a summary of the necessary actions to be done when one of the conditions of NLG steering overtravel occurred. (2) Although these procedures are conservative, there is no satisfactory procedure to quantify the severity of the failure on internal components because of incorrect or accidental operation of the NLG shock strut steering. (3) When the conditional inspection tells you that you must examine the NLG, NLG wheelwell and/or aircraft structure, look for the conditions that follow: • Bent components • Black powder residues around, and that trail from, fasterners in composites (sign of loose fasteners) • Cracks • Delamination • Discoloration • Fastener holes that become oversized • Fasteners that pulled out or are missing • Fiber breakouts • Hydraulic fluid leakage • Interference • Loose fasteners • Loose paint (paint flakes) EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 05-50-32 Page 4 of 19 Rev 51 - Oct 31/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
