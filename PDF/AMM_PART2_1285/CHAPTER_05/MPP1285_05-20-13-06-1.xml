			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) If necessary, clean the inspection area (AMM TASK 12-22-00-600-801-A/300) or (AMM TASK 12-22-00-600-802-A/300) as applicable. J. External General Visual Inspection (Figure 601)  (Figure 602)  SUBTASK 212-002-A WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE PITOT AND TAT SENSORS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SYSTEM IS TURNED OFF. THE HIGH TEMPERATURE CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. (1) Examine the fuselage zone for painting bad condition, loose rivets, skin deformation, sealant poor condition, scratches, gouges, creases, nicks, cracks, dents, erosion, corrosion, and deteriorated protective treatment. (2) Examine the fuselage skin panel at stringers and frames/bulkheads, pressure bulkhead and splices for loose rivets, nicks, cracks, dents, erosion, corrosion, and deteriorated protective treatment (Figure 601). (3) Examine the fuselage skin longitudinal and circumferential splices for loose rivets, nicks, cracks, dents, erosion, corrosion, and deteriorated protective treatment (Figure 601). (4) Examine the AOA sensor and ice detector for loose screws and washers, painting bad condition, nicks, cracks, dents, scratches, gouges, erosion, corrosion, and sealant poor condition (Figure 601). (5) Examine the cockpit windshield for delaminations and crazing (Figure 602). (6) Examine the windshield lateral post and its attachment for painting bad condition, loose rivets, sealant poor condition, twisted parts, scratches, gouges, nicks, cracks, dents, erosion, corrosion, and deteriorated protective treatment (Figure 602). (7) Examine the windshield and cockpit escape hatch aerodynamic sealing to make sure that is not scratched, gouged, creased, scored, cracked or ruptured (Figure 603). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the ladder. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 05-20-13 Page 3 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
