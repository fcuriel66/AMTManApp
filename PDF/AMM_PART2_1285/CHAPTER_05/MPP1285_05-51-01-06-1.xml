			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL HIRF/LIGHTNING - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. HIRF means High-Intensity Radiated Fields. B. The electroele ctronic equipment, installed on the aircraft, is covered by electromagnetic fields that are generated by the systems installed on the aircraft or by external HIRF, because of a radar station, broadcasting station, or other aircraft. HIRF can cause unwanted interference with the installed equipment or wiring. C. The growing use of electronic systems and the simultaneous use of several structural parts made of composite material increase the concern about the vulnerability of the aircraft to the direct and indirect effects of lightning. D. The undesirable HIRF/LIGHTNING effects are prevented by: • Qualification of systems at predefined HIRF/LIGHTNING levels. • Installation of protective features such as harness shielding, special terminations, extensive use of electrical bonding, and use of copper for components embedded in composite structures. E. This section gives the procedures to do a detailed visual inspection on the electrical/electronic connectors, bonding jumpers, and conductive gaskets of the aircraft critical systems, installed in environmentally exposed areas, in flight control surfaces, and lightning current critical path areas. Examine them for possible degradation of HIRF/LIGHTNING protection features because of aircraft aging and operation in adverse environments. F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 05-51-01-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. HIRF/LIGHTNING PROTECTION - INSPECTION A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do a detailed visual inspection on the electrical/electronic connectors, bonding jumpers, and conductive gaskets of the aircraft critical systems, in regions without pressure, for possible degradation of the HIRF/Lightning protections. NOTE: • Do not disassemble connectors when you do this task. • Do not remove the seal when you do this task. • Only remove system LRUs if it is necessary to get access to connectors. • If the connector is protected with heat-shrinkable boot, only remove the boot if it is damaged. • It is not necessary to do a check along the harness. If you find a damage to the harness, write it down and do the necessary repairs after the end of the task. B.

S.B.145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (2) On aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, install the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (3) Put a "DO-NOT-OPERATE-THE-FLIGHT-CONTROLS" warning tag at the control wheels and control pedestal in the cockpit. (4) Deenergize the aircraft. (5) Put the hydraulic platform in the correct position and at the necessary height. J. Inspect (Detailed Inspection) HIRF/Lightning Protection Systems Electrical and Electronic Connectors SUBTASK 220-002-A (1) Nose HIRF/Lightning Protection - Inspection. (a) Do a detailed visual inspection on the connectors and bonding jumpers shown in the tables, as follows: 1 Make sure: a That the connectors and backshells are tight, the shield termination at the tag-rings is attached, and there is no damage, corrosion, or deformation at the connector. b If there is lockwire on the connector assembly, that it is not loose and, if the connector is protected with a heat-shrinkable boot, that there is no damage to the boot. If there is damage to the boot, replace the boot. Before you install the new boot, do the steps above. c That the bonding jumpers are attached and that there is no damage, corrosion, or deformation at the bonding jumper.
