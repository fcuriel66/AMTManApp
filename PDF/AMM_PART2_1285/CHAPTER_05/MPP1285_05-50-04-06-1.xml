			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL MAXIMUM OPERATING SPEED ENVELOPE EXCEEDED - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the necessary actions following an overspeed event. B. The exceedance of the operating speed/Mach envelope will trigger the high-speed aural warning with triple chime. C. An overspeed inspection is required when the crew reports the trigger of the high-speed aural warning with triple chime or the FDR data analysis shows that the operating speed envelope was exceeded. D. The operating speed envelope is presented in the AFM (Aircraft Flight Manual) - Section 2 - Limitations and it is also shown here, in Figure 601. E. Based on the speed envelope, two threshold curves are set, in order to classify the severity of the overspeed event into one of the following three situations: (1) Below the Low-Threshold Curve: The low-threshold curve defines an overspeed limit for which no inspection of the aircraft is required and the aircraft can be promptly returned to service, provided that the crew is sure that some requirements were observed. (2) Between Low and High Threshold Curves: This region defines a situation clearly out of the aircraft envelope, but the operator can still restore the aircraft airworthiness, without Embraer involvement, provided that no discrepancies are found during the applicable inspections. (3) Above High-Threshold Curve: The high-threshold curve defines an excess to the aircraft operating speed, within a high degree of severity for which the operator has still the necessary information to restore the aircraft airworthiness, but in this case Embraer shall be informed and receive the FDR data. F. The purpose of this section is to provide the operator all tools to analyze the flight data in order to restore the aircraft airworthiness. Embraer shall be involved only if one of the following situations occur: (1) Send the FDR data and the inspections results to Embraer if any discrepancy is found during the inspection Phases I, II or III, but the operator is still responsible to ensure, based on the required inspections, that the aircraft can be returned to service, or; (2) During any phased inspection, a discrepancy is found. In this situation, the operator shall send to Embraer the FDR data analysis and a report of the discrepancies found. To return the aircraft to service an Embraer disposition is required. G. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 05-50-04-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. OVERSPEED INSPECTION A. General (1) The required actions following an overspeed event are visually presented in the flowchart shown in Figure 602. (2) Once the crew reports the high-speed aural warning with triple chime trigger, the aircraft may be returned to service without any further action provided that the crew can guarantee all the three situations below: (a) The speed remains below the low threshold curve, for all flight ratings; (b) The overspeed does not last for more than 10 seconds. (c) No more than one event occurs in the same flight. (3) If the crew cannot assure that all the three conditions above were respected, the FDR download must be performed and the data shall be analyzed. (4) If is not possible to do the FDR analysis immediately, a fly by of 10 FC is provided, once Phase-I inspection is done and no abnormality is detected. NOTE: In this case, Phase-I inspection shall be done before next flight. (5) Within the fly-by period the FDR data is analyzed and compared with threshold values, then the necessary actions are determined. (6) For the event assessment the following parameters should be selected from the FDR ( AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500): • Date; • Time (GMT); • Flight Number; • Pressure Altitude (PrAlt); • Indicated Airspeed (IAS); • Normal acceleration (NrAcc).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Plot the threshold curves and the FDR data all together, in order to visually identify the severity of the event. To do this, do as follows: (a) Select from the FDR the parameters KIAS and Altitude during the overspeed occurrence. (b) Plot over the Figure 603, the selected data. NOTE: If the high-speed aural warning with triple chime has triggered more than once, add all the related sets of points from the FDR to the chart. (c) Table 601, Table 602 and Table 603, present the points to plot the operational envelope and the threshold curves, if necessary. NOTE: The values that follow are approximate and can change as the temperature changes. Table 601 - OPERATIONAL ENVELOPE Point IAS (Knots) Altitude (ft) A 200 37000 B 250 37000 C 320 26000 D 320 10000 E 250 8000 F 250 0 Table 602 - LOW THRESHOLD CURVE COORDINATES POINT IAS (knots) Altitude (ft) A 200 37000 G 255 37000 H 330 25500 J 330 0 Table 603 - HIGH THRESHOLD CURVE COORDINATES POINT IAS (knots) Altitude (ft) A 200 37000 K 260 37000 L 350 24000 M 350 0 (d) Analyze the FDR data relatively to the threshold curves and identify the point that is most distant from the threshold curves and chart origin. This point features the most critical instant within the overspeed event. (2) Refer to Table 604 for the necessary actions considering the position of the most critical sample.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Table 604 - OVERSPEED SEVERITY AND REQUIRED ACTIONS Most-critical Sample Position Required Action No action is required and the aircraft can be re- turned to service, provided that:   — The overspeed does not last for more than 10 seconds.   Below T low — No more than one event occurs in the same flight.   NOTE: If one of these conditions was not respec- ted, consider it as an event between T and T . low high   1. Do the Phase-I inspection before the next flight;   2. If no discrepancy is found during Phase-I in- spection, download the FDR and dispatch the air- craft by 10 FC. Otherwise, contact Embraer;   3. Do the Phase-II inspection within the fly-by peri- od; Between T and T low high   4. If no discrepancy is found during Phase-II in- spection, return the aircraft to service. Otherwise, do the Phase-III inspection and contact Embraer;   5. Send the FDR data and the inspections results to Embraer if any discrepancy is found during the inspection Phases I, II or III. 1. Do the Phase-I inspection before the next flight; 2. If no discrepancy is found during Phase-I in- spection, dispatch the aircraft by 10 FC. Other- wise, contact Embraer; 3. Do the Phase-II and Phase-III inspections; Above T 4. If no discrepancy is found during Phase-II and high Phase-III inspections, dispatch the aircraft. Other- wise, contact Embraer. 5. Send the FDR data and the inspections results to Embraer if any discrepancy is found during the inspection Phases I, II or III. (3) Check for the interval containing the off-envelope points if the Normal Acceleration does not exceed 2G. If such a case occurs, do AMM TASK 05-50-05-200-801-A/600. NOTE: This check is necessary once for a speed out of the envelope the threshold for this parameters decreases to 2.0 G. J.
