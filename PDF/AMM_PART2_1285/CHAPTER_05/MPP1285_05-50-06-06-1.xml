			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL LANDING GEAR DOWN OVERSPEED - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. The structural and general inspections in this section are applicable after the landing gear was extended in flight at speeds above the maximum placarded permitted values. B. This section gives the procedure to do an inspection of the main and nose landing gear doors after a landing gear down overspeed condition. C. The Indicated Air Speed (IAS) limits for flight with landing-gear in transit or locked down are given in Section 2 of the AFM and named as follows: • V for retraction is the maximum speed at which the landing gear can be safely retracted. LO • V for extension is the maximum speed at which the landing gear can be safely extended. LO • V is the maximum speed at which the airplane can be safely flown with the landing gear LE extended and locked. D. The V for retraction value is 200 KIAS, the V for extension value is 250 KIAS and the V value LO LO LE is 250 KIAS. E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).
