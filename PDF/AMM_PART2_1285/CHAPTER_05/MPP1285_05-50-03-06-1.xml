			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL HIGH DRAG/SIDE LOAD LANDING CONDITION - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. The landing is a high drag/side load landing when the aircraft: – goes in such as skid on the runway that the aircraft safety is put at risk – makes a landing which causes two or more tires to blow – makes a landing before the prepared surface – goes in a skid or goes from the prepared surface to an unprepared surface NOTE: If this landing condition occurs together with a hard landing condition, other inspection will be necessary ( AMM TASK 05-50-02-200-801-A/600). B. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Jack the aircraft and retract and extend the landing gears (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-801-A/200). (2) Make sure that landing gear safety pins are installed on the main and nose landing gears ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (3) For aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No.1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (4) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, make sure that the safety pin of the NLG doors solenoid valve are installed (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). J. Inspection SUBTASK 212-002-A (1) NOTE: If this landing condition occurs together with a hard landing condition, an accurate inspection must be made ( AMM TASK 05-50-02-200-801-A/600). Examine the aircraft as follow: (a) Examine the aircraft for signs of interference, misalignment, or distortion. In case of damage, do the aircraft alignment (AMM TASK 51-50-01-820-801-A/200). (b) Examine the main-landing-gear wheels for signs of damage (e.g., cracks, deformation, etc). NOTE: If it is necessary to replace the wheel because of blown tires or flat tires after a high drag/side load landing condition, do an accurate inspection on the wheel that was removed (BF Goodrich 32-49-02). (c) Examine the main-landing-gear drag struts for distortion or cracks. (d) Examine the main-landing-gear leg strut and leg strut attachment fittings for cracks, distortion, and loose fasteners. (e) Examine the main-landing-gear trunnion and trunnion-link support fittings for cracks and signs of bushing elongation or bolt distortion. (f) Visually examine the main-landing-gear wheelwell for signs of fuel leaks or other fluid leaks. (g) Examine the aft nose-gear-wheelwell bulkhead and fuselage structure outboard of the nose wheelwell for distortion, buckling, flaking paint, cracks, and loose or missing fasteners. (h) Examine the nose gear wheelwell structure and adjacent lower fuselage structure for distortion, flaking paint, cracks, and pulled or missing fasteners. (i) Examine the cargo arresting net for integrity if applicable. (j) Examine the baggage compartment lining ( AMM TASK 25-51-01-200-801-A/ 600).
