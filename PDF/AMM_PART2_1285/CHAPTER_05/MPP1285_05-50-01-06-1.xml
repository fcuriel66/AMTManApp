			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL LIGHTNING STRIKE - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedure to do a general inspection/check after a lightning strike on the aircraft. B. Lightning: (1) Lightning always has two or more attachment points (one entry and one exit) on the aircraft skin. (2) Lightning usually attaches to the aircraft in zones of high curvature (for example nose, engine inlets). (3) Lightning moves back along the surface of the aircraft (swept stroke zone). This can cause a chain of scattered attachment points along a line in the direction of travel of the aircraft. During this sweeping movement, the lightning stays attached in the exit point. C. Effects on the aircraft structure and systems. The lightning strike can cause direct and indirect effects on the aircraft: (1) Direct effects. The direct effects are the physical damage related to signs such as: (a) Pitting/meltthrough: • This is the action of the electrical arc made when a lightning stroke attaches to the aircraft (arc root damage at the attachment points or damage caused by current flow which can also appear far from the attachment points). • Signs of a lightning attachment are pitting and scorch marks and paint discoloration. • On composite components, paint discoloration and skin puncturing and also some delamination of the fibers can occur. If there is skin puncturing, there can be damage to the grounded equipment below the composite-material fairings. (b) Resistive heating: • When lightning currents flow through an aircraft structure, energy is changed into heat along its path. • Resistive heating usually causes marks of the weld type, specially where the lightning current flows for some time. (c) Magnetic force: • The damage usually occurs where a small area causes the density of the current to be high. (d) Acoustic shock wave: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 General 05-50-01 Page 1 of 32 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • When a lightning strike occurs, there is an acoustic shock wave. If the intensity of this shock wave is high, it can cause deformation of thin metal skins or rupture of thin composite skins. (2) Indirect effects: (a) Electromagnetic fields: • The electromagnetic fields related to the lightning attachment can cause unwanted transient voltages and currents in the aircraft wiring and systems. In some conditions, the effect on the systems can be temporary and the systems can operate correctly again after the strike. In other conditions, the damage can be permanent and it will be necessary to replace parts. • This electromagnetic fields can also magnetize some steel parts on the aircraft. D. Aircraft zoning: (1) The aircraft surfaces are divided into three zones, and each zone has different lightning attachment and/or transfer characteristics. Zones 1 and 2 can be divided again into A and B regions if there is the probability that the flash will hang on for a long time. They are defined as follows: (a) Zone 1: Surfaces of the aircraft for which there is a high probability of initial lightning flash attachment (entry or exit). 1 Zone 1A: Initial attachment point with low probability of flash hang-on; for example, a leading edge. 2 Zone 1B: Initial attachment point with high probability of flash hang-on; for example, a trailing edge. (b) Zone 2: Surfaces of the aircraft across which there is a high probability that a lightning flash will be swept by the airflow from a zone 1 point of initial flash attachment. 1 Zone 2A: A swept stroke zone with low probability of flash hang-on; for example, wing midspan. 2 Zone 2B: A swept stroke zone with high probability of flash hang-on; for example, an elevator trailing edge. (c) Zone 3: Zone 3 includes all of the aircraft areas not included in zone 1 and zone 2 regions. In zone 3 there is a low probability of an attachment of the direct lightning flash arc. Zone 3 areas can carry large quantities of electrical current but only by direct conduction between some pair of direct or swept stroke attachment points. E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 05-50-01-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. LIGHTNING STRIKE - GENERAL INSPECTION A. General (1) This task gives the procedure to do a general inspection after a lightning strike. (2) When you do the inspection, look for all the usual signs of lightning strike damage, which are: • Burning or scorching of the aircraft skin. • Pitting damage to the aircraft skin. • Discoloration of the surface finish. • Loose or missing rivets. • Damaged or loose components. • Damage to the aircraft structure. (3) The ground persons must write the related data in the LIGHTNING STRIKE INCIDENT REPORT form (Figure 604) and send the form for EMBRAER to complete the lightning data base. Part I of the LIGHTNING STRIKE INCIDENT REPORT form is for the flight crew and is shown in the Airplane Operation Manual, vol. 1, page block 1-03-70. (4) All events reported by the crew must be checked in addition/conjunction with this inspection. (5) The lightning attachment zones are shown in Figure 601. (6) The bonding jumpers are used to be a very low resistance path for the current from one part of the aircraft structure to other one. The electrical bonding map ( AMM TASK 20-13-21-210-801-A/200) shows the primary bonding jumpers that are in the most probable path of a lightning strike. NOTE: Some external mounted bonding jumpers are required, but they are not essential for all flights. The aircraft can be dispatched without some of these bonding jumpers, following the maintenance instructions in electrical bonding map ( AMM TASK 20-13-21-210-801-A/200). For damaged bonding jumpers in other locations, call Embraer Technical Support to receive proper orientation. (7) As a result of this task, you will have to do detailed inspections on the areas affected by the lightning strike. This is an example of inspection (Figure 603) and detailed inspection that is necessary in this case: (a) After a general inspection, you find out that the lightning entry point was the nose and the exit point was the horizontal stabilizer. (b) Marks come into view on the fuselage between the entry and exit point. (c) With the lightning inspection map (Figure 603), you find out that a detailed inspection on these areas is necessary: • Forward Fuselage and Nose Landing Gear.
