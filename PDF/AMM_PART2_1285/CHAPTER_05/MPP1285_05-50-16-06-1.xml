			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL HIGH ENERGY STOP - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. When the aircraft aborts the takeoff for any reason or when the aircraft makes an Overweight Landing, this can be a condition of High Energy Stop. B. You must do an inspection after a High Energy Stop when the conditions below occur: • The message BRAKE OVERHEAT is shown and at least one of the Brake Temperature Indicator on the MFD reaches the upper limit, after an aborted takeoff or an Overweight Landing. • One or more wheel fuse-plugs were released duel to energy dissipated by the brakes during an aborted takeoff or an Overweight Landing. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 05-50-16-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. HIGH ENERGY STOP - INSPECTION A. General (1) Do an inspection on the landing gear, wheels and brakes after a high energy stop condition. (2) If a BRAKE OVERHEAT message occurs, initially only a general visual inspection is necessary. (3) If one or more wheel fuse-plugs were released, you must do a detailed inspection. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Make sure that landing gear safety pins are installed on the main and nose landing gears ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). • WARNING: IF ONE OR MORE WHEEL FUSE PLUGS ARE RELEASED, DO NOT GO NEAR THE LANDING GEAR AREA FOR ONE HOUR. IF THIS IS NECESSARY BEFORE ONE HOUR, GO NEAR THE AREA VERY CAREFULLY AND ONLY FROM THE FRONT OR REAR OF THE TIRES. DO THIS WHEN ONE OR ALL OF THE TIRES ARE INFLATED. INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. • MAKE SURE THAT THE LATERAL AREA OF THE TIRE IS CLEAR TO PREVENT POSSIBLE INJURY TO PERSONS. • DO NOT SPRAY EXTINGUISHER OR COOLANT DIRECTLY ON THE INFLATED TIRE OR WHEEL. THIS CAN CAUSE AN EXPLOSION AND INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (3) For High Energy Stop where one or more wheel fuse-plugs were released, do the detailed inspection on the wheels, brakes, and axle. (4) For High Energy Stop where the message BRAKE OVERHEAT is shown and at least one of the Brake Temperature Indicator on the MFD reached the upper limit, do the general visual Inspection on the wheels and brakes. NOTE: • Remove and discard the pair of tires of the main landing gear, if at least one of them deflated while the aircraft was in movement (AMM TASK 32-49-01-000-801-A/400). • If one of the tires deflated with the aircraft stopped, replace and discard it. Do an inspection on the paired tire (AMM TASK 32-49-01-000-801-A/ 400). J. Special Inspection SUBTASK 280-002-A WARNING: • IF ONE OR MORE WHEEL FUSE PLUGS ARE RELEASED, DO NOT GO NEAR THE LANDING GEAR AREA FOR ONE HOUR. IF THIS IS NECESSARY BEFORE ONE HOUR, GO NEAR THE AREA VERY CAREFULLY AND ONLY FROM THE FRONT OR REAR OF THE TIRES. DO THIS WHEN ONE OR ALL OF THE TIRES ARE INFLATED. INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. • MAKE SURE THAT THE LATERAL AREA OF THE TIRE IS CLEAR TO PREVENT POSSIBLE INJURY TO PERSONS. • DO NOT SPRAY EXTINGUISHER OR COOLANT DIRECTLY ON THE INFLATED TIRE OR WHEEL. THIS CAN CAUSE AN EXPLOSION AND INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (1) General visual inspection: (a) Do a general visual inspection on the brakes, wheels, tires, harness and wires of the main landing gear for signs of overheat damage (e.g., hydraulic fluid leakage, color changes, crack signs, etc.).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Do the detailed inspection below if signs of overheat damage were found. (2) Detailed inspection: (a) Do a completed inspection on the brakes, wheels and axle, if one or more wheel fuse-plug were released or if signs of damage were found. (b) Remove only the wheels and brakes of the main landing gear where the wheel fuse-plug was released or where signs of damage were found ( AMM TASK 32-49-02-000-801-A/400) and ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-000-801-A/400). (c) Examine the wheels that were removed. Refer to "Special Procedures for Overheated Wheels" (BF Goodrich CMM 32-49-02). (d) Examine the brakes that were removed. An accurate inspection is necessary on a brake assembly that the fuse-plug was released. Obey all the procedures of "Check" in (BF Goodrich CMM 32-49-03). (e) Examine the wheel axle exterior surface for signs of overheat damage (e.g., color changes, crack signs, etc.). (f) Examine the wheel speed transducer. For this, it is not necessary to remove it. Do a check to make sure that there is free movement of the transducer and correct attachment of the bolt. Replace the wheel speed transducer if necessary. (g) Examine the integrity of the electrical harness and wires of the main landing gear. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the circuit break panel, close the CMD circuit breaker and remove the DO NOT CLOSE tag to it. (2) Make sure that landing-gear safety pins are not installed on the main and nose landing gears ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200).
