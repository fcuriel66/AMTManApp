			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL ICE OR SNOW CONDITION - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. When the aircraft surfaces have accumulation of frozen moisture (ice or snow) or freezing precipitation adheres to the surfaces, they must be deiced before the aircraft is dispatched. B. This section gives the procedures to be done on the aircraft surfaces before flight when ice- formation or snow-accumulation condition occurs. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Inspection SUBTASK 200-002-A WARNING: • NO AIRCRAFT MUST BE DISPATCHED OR TAKE OFF WHEN THE WINGS OR TAIL SURFACES HAVE ACCUMULATION OF ICE, SNOW, OR FROST. • BE SPECIALLY CAREFUL WITH THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE WING. THIS AREA CAN CONTAIN A THIN LAYER OF ICE THAT YOU CANNOT SEE AND IT MUST BE EXAMINED BY TOUCH. (1) Before the flight, examine the aircraft surfaces as follows for accumulation of ice or snow. If there is an ice formation or snow on the aircraft surfaces, do the cold-weather maintenance practices ( AMM TASK 12-30-01-860-801-A/200). (a) Examine the fuselage for signs of ice formation or snow accumulation. (b) Examine the wings for signs of ice formation. Do an inspection on the upper surface of the wing by touch. It is possible that there is a thin ice layer that you cannot see. (c) Examine all flight control surfaces for icing accumulation and/or packed ice in the hinge gaps. Operate all control surfaces to make sure that they can move along their full travel. (d) Examine all flight control surfaces to make sure that they are free of icing contamination. (e) Make sure that the engine air-conditioning, vent, and NACA air inlets are clear and/or not obstructed. (f) Examine the landing gear doors and locks, the proximity sensors, the free-fall device, the brakes, and the auxiliary brace structure for signs of ice or snow accumulation. (g) Make sure that all sensors (pitot sensors/pitot/static sensor/anemometric and pressurization static ports/TAT probes/ice detectors/angle-of-attack (AOA) sensors) are free of ice or snow accumulation and/or obstructions (h) Make sure that the main door, escape hatches, windshields, and windows are free of ice or snow accumulation. (i) Make sure that all waste water and condensation drains on the aircraft have no ice or obstructions. (j) Examine APU area and the following components: 1 APU Air Inlet Inspection; 2 APU Starter-Generator Air Inlet; 3 APU Oil-Cooler Air Inlet; 4 APU Air Inlet Screen Frame; 5 APU Exhaust Ducts; EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 05-50-10 Page 3 of 4 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
