General (1) This task gives the procedure to do an inspection after the aircraft is submitted to a speed higher than the maximum flap extended speed (V ). FE NOTE: • There is no message on the EICAS and CMC displays. • There are distinct values of V according to the deflection angle of the flap FE surface. • To consider only the flap lever position to determine whether the flap has exceeded its maximum speed. (2) EFFECTIVITY: FOR EMB-145 MODELS EXCEPT EMB-145 XR The Maximum Flap Extended Speeds are given in the LIMITATIONS section of the Airplane Flight Manual and are according to the table below: Table 601 Flap Lever Position V (KIAS) T (KIAS) FE V 9ÃÂº 250 260 18ÃÂº 200 210 22ÃÂº 200 210 45ÃÂº 145 160 NOTE: If the flap speed is between V (maximum flap extended speed) and T (threshold FE V value), for a given flap lever position, no inspection is necessary. If the flap speed is greater than T , the necessary inspections are listed in this task. V (3) EFFECTIVITY: FOR EMB-145 XR The Maximum Flap Extended Speeds are given in the LIMITATIONS section of the Airplane Flight Manual and are according to the table below: Table 602 Flap Lever Position V (KIAS) T (KIAS) FE V 9ÃÂº 250 260 18ÃÂº 200 210 22ÃÂº 200 210 45ÃÂº 160 160 NOTE: If the flap speed is between V (maximum flap extended speed) and T (threshold FE V value), for a given flap lever position, no inspection is necessary.

Eddy Current Inspection Procedure for VFE Exceedance SUBTASK 212-003-A (1) This task gives the procedure to inspect the SSI 57-28-59 and SSI 57-50-80, by the Eddy Current Inspection Method. (2) This inspection requires flap removal if the V exceedance event occurred with the FE flap at 45ÃÂ° position and can be done without flap removal for V exceedance at 9ÃÂ°, 18ÃÂ° FE and 22ÃÂ° position. (a) For V exceedance event occurred with the flap at 9ÃÂ°, 18ÃÂ° and 22ÃÂ° position, FE extend the flap at 45ÃÂ° position and inspect the areas specified in the tasks, according to Table 603. (3) Any other Eddy Current instrument that satisfies the performance requirements of this procedure may be used. (4) Tools, Equipment and Auxiliary Items.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (5) Preparation (a) Statically ground the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-02-910-801-A/200). (b) Set the Flap at 45ÃÂ° position, if the V exceedance occurred with the flap at 9ÃÂ°, FE 18ÃÂ° and 22ÃÂ° position. (c) Remove the inboard flap (AMM TASK 27-50-00-000-801-A/400) and the outboard flap (AMM TASK 27-50-00-000-802-A/400) if the V exceedance occurred with FE the flap at 45ÃÂ° position. (d) Clean the parts to be inspected. (6) Equipment Calibration (Figure 602) and (Figure 603). (a) After having connected the probe to the equipment, adjust the instrument frequency in agreement with the used probe. (b) Put the probe in the reference standard (Figure 602) in an area that does not have an artificial crack. The probe must fit tightly but not to the point that it causes excessive wear on the probe coil. (c) Select the control of rotation phase to obtain the sign of lift-off in the horizontal position or, if using an analog equipment, compensate the lift-off in accordance with the operation manual. (d) Scan the reference standard in a similar way and adjust the controls of gain of the equipment for obtaining the sign of the smallest artificial crack, 0.2 mm (0.008 in.) artificial crack depth, at least 10% of the scale (Figure 603). (e) Before beginning to scan an area of different geometry than the previous one, a balance should be made in the equipment because geometric variations, edge or hole margins, and presence of different materials close to the scanning area can induce false indications. (f) Balance the instrument as specified in the manufacturer's instructions. (g) Adjust the sensitivity of the instrument to give an 80% meter deflection when a scan is done slowly over the reference artificial crack with the probe. (h) Position the probe again in an area that is not an artificial crack. Check the balance and the lift-off. If adjustments are needed, check the sensitivity again. (7) Procedure (Figure 604, Figure 605, Figure 606, Figure 607, Figure 608 and Figure 609). (a) Check the setting of the lift-off again as referred to in item (6) (c). (b) Scanning in radii should be made in longitudinal and traverse directions, with attention being paid to the edge effect. (c) Be sure that the probe is set as close as possible to 90ÃÂ° to the surface of the part. (d) Scan the whole area of interest as described in: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 05-50-07 Page 5 of 23 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

(a) Statically ground the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-02-910-801-A/200). (b) Remove access panels (1), (2), (3) and (4) (Figure 612). (c) Open the lower shroud of the inboard and outboard flaps. (d) Set the inboard and outboard flaps to 18ÃÂ° and after to 20ÃÂ° positions. NOTE: Adjust the inboard and outboard flaps to ÃÂ± 2ÃÂ° position, as indicated above, to increase the exposed inspection area. (e) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN USING SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN HANDLING THEM. AVOID TO BREATHE SOLVENT VAPORS AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (f) Before the inspection, wipe the surface clean with methyl-ethyl-ketone (MEK) (ASTM-D-740) or similar solvent. (g) Do visual check at inspection area for obvious damages that can cause false indications on equipment signals or can cause excessive wear to the probe tip. (7) Equipment Calibration (Figure 602, Figure 610, Figure 611, Figure 612, Figure 613 and Figure 614). (a) Mold the probe to get access to the area where you will do the inspection, in compliance with Table 606 (Figure 610, Figure 612, Figure 613 and Figure 614).

(c) Adjust the instrument frequency 2 MHz. Set Gain to 30 dB (to start setup). (d) Put the probe in the reference standard (Figure 602) surface, far enough from EDM Notches. Hold probe as near as possible to 90ÃÂ° at standard surface; do not use excessive force to avoid excessive wear on the probe tip. (e) Use the phase rotation control to get the lift-off signal in the horizontal position of Impedance Plane Display. If you use Meter Display equipment, compensate the liftoff as shown in the operation manual (Figure 602). (f) Scan the reference standard in a proper velocity and adjust the Gain of the equipment to get at least 10% of the scale signal for the smallest artificial crack depth of 0.2 mm (0.008 in.) (Figure 611). (g) Scan again the reference standard in a proper velocity and check if the equipment displays at least 80% of the scale signal for the artificial crack depth of 1.0 mm (0.040 in.) (Figure 611). (h) Balance the instrument signals as specified in the manufacturer’s instructions. (i) Position the probe again in an area that is not an artificial crack. Do a check of the balance and lift-off. If adjustments are necessary, do a check of the sensitivity again. (8) Procedure (Figure 610, Figure 612, Figure 613, and Figure 614). (a) Before you start to scan an area of different geometry than the previous one, you must make a balance in the equipment. This is because geometric variations, track edges or fastener holes edge, and presence of different materials near the scanning area can cause false indications. NOTE: During the inspection, do not change the frequency or gain controls in order to avoid missing the signal amplitude from reference standard. If necessary to increase or decrease gain, check the amplitude level at reference standard (Paragraph 7). (b) Do a check of the setting of the lift-off again as indicated in item (7) (c). (c) You must do the scanning in radii in longitudinal and transverse directions. Pay attention to the edge effect signals. (d) Be sure that the probe is set as near as possible to 90ÃÂ° to the surface of the part. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 05-50-07 Page 8 of 23 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
