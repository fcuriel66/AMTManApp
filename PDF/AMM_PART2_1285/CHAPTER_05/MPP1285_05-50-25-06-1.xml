			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL OVERWEIGHT LANDING - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. An overweight landing inspection is necessary after a landing is done with the aircraft above the MLW (Maximum Landing Weight) which can cause loads out of the design limit envelope. It is necessary when the crew is not able to make sure that the SR (Sink Rate) was smaller than 6 FPS (Feet per Second). B. When the crew cannot make sure that the sink rate was not more than the 6 FPS limit at touchdown, this procedure permits you to use FDR data for the check of the loads in the landing against the aircraft landing envelope. For this procedure, the vertical CG acceleration is used. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 05-50-25-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. OVERWEIGHT LANDING A. General (1) Refer to Figure 601. The flowchart is a summary of the necessary actions when an overweight landing occurs. (2) When the crew cannot make sure that the vertical speed was not more than the permitted limit during the touchdown, do the Phase-I inspection immediately. If you find no incorrect condition during the Phase-I inspection, a fly-by of 10 FC (Flight Cycles) is permitted. Then you can do one of these two procedures: (a) At the end of the fly-by period, do the Phase-II inspection. In this case, no FDR data analysis is necessary. It will be necessary to do the Phase-III inspection only if you find an incorrect condition during the Phase-II inspection. (b) During the fly-by period, obey the instructions contained in this section to analyze the FDR data. The Phase-II inspection must then be done only if the data analysis shows that the landing conditions do not obey the threshold limits given in this section for the MLG touchdown, as a function of vertical CG acceleration and aircraft weight at touchdown. The Phase-III inspection will be done only if you find an incorrect condition during the Phase-II inspection. (3) The procedure to find an excess to the landing envelope when an overweight landing occurs and the related inspections are applicable only to the MLG. Do the hard landing inspection ( AMM TASK 05-50-02-200-801-A/600) if the crew reports one of these two conditions: • The aircraft touches the ground with the NLG first; • The crew reports a suspect hard landing in the NLG because of high pitch angle variation. (4) For an overweight landing analysis, these parameters from the FDR data are necessary ( AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500): • Vertical CG acceleration (normal acceleration) • Air/Ground indication • Time (GMT) • Date • Flight number (5) The procedures that we give you here are conservative. Their function is to permit you to find an envelope exceedance condition and put the related aircraft in a serviceable condition. If you will not do a Phase-III inspection, it is not necessary to send data to Embraer. But, if you must do a Phase-III inspection, send the data to Embraer for analysis (FDR data and a report of the damage found). The decision to put the aircraft back into service will then be made by Embraer together with you.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Get the aircraft mass at landing. NOTE: • A satisfactory procedure to have an estimate of the aircraft mass at the landing can be used. • When it is not possible to make an estimate of the aircraft mass at landing, use, in a conservative approach, the aircraft mass at the take- off. (3) With the two parameters (Maximum CG acceleration and aircraft mass), refer to Figure 602 to know if an excess to the aircraft landing envelope occurred. (4) If the vertical CG acceleration peak recorded by the FDR at the MLG touchdown is not higher than the vertical CG acceleration permitted for the aircraft mass at touchdown, no other action is necessary and the aircraft can be put back into service. (5) If the vertical CG acceleration peak recorded by the FDR at the MLG touchdown is higher than the vertical CG acceleration permitted for the aircraft mass at touchdown, do the Phase-II inspection. (6) If you find no incorrect condition during the Phase-II inspection, no other action is necessary and you can put the aircraft back into service. If you find an incorrect condition during the Phase-II inspection, do the Phase-III inspection and send Embraer these data: (a) FDR data that contain the overweight landing incident; (b) Report of the incorrect conditions that you found during the preceding inspections. NOTE: When you do a Phase-III inspection on an aircraft, send Embraer the flight data and a report of the damage that you found. You and Embraer together will then make the decision to put the aircraft back into service. J. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the landing gear safety pins are installed to the main and nose landing gears ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200).
