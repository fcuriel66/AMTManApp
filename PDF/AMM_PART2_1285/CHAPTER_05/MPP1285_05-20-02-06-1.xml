			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Open the radome and lock it in a safe position to get access to the weather RTA (AMM MPP 06-30-00/100). J. Internal General Visual Inspection (Figure 601)  (Figure 602)  SUBTASK 212-002-A (1) Examine the interior of the zone for loose rivets, skin deformation, nicks, cracks, dents, delaminations, sealant condition, scratches, erosion, painting, deteriorated protective treatment, rubber seal condition, and bonding jumper condition (e.g. signs of overheating, rupture, broken strands, and frays) (Figure 601). (2) Examine the glide slope antenna for dirt condition, skin deformation, nicks, cracks, dents, scratches, erosion, corrosion, painting, sealant condition, disconnection, signs of overheating (Figure 602). (3) Examine the radar for loose rivets, dirt condition, nicks, cracks, dents, painting, sealant condition, corrosion, broken strands, rupture, bend, signs of overheating, frays, cracks, and crushing (Figure 602). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) (Aircraft equipped with one weather radar controller) On the circuit breaker panel, close the RADAR circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (2) (Aircraft equipped with two weather radar controllers) On the circuit breaker panel, close the RADAR CONT 1 and RADAR CONT 2/RTA circuit breakers, and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tags from them. (3) Close the radome and lock it. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 05-20-02 Page 3 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>
