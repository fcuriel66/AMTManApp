			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL HARD LANDING - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. A hard landing inspection is necessary after a non-normal landing condition, when the loads can be outside the design limit envelope. This envelope includes a combination of aircraft weight, vertical CG acceleration at touchdown, and ambient temperature. B. This tasks accounts for: (1) Hard Landing - is an exceedance of the vertical CG acceleration threshold; (2) Off-envelope Landing - is an exceedance of the ambient temperature limit. C. In case of overweight landing, refer to AMM TASK 05-50-25-200-801-A/600. D. A hard landing inspection is necessary when: the crew members report on the aircraft technical Log Book that they think that a hard landing occurred; or when the analysis of the flight operation data shows that the envelope of landing parameters was not obeyed. E. Although, for the regulation, the sink rate parameter will define a hard landing, the data acquisition system does not give accurate data for you to use this parameter to define a hard landing. Thus, the procedures that follow use the vertical CG acceleration (for MLG hard landing detection) and the pitch rate (for NLG hard landing detection). F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 05-50-02-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. HARD LANDING A. General (1) Refer to Figure 601. The flowchart is a summary of the necessary actions when the crew reports that a possible hard landing occurred or when the analysis of flight data shows that a hard landing occurred. (2) When the crew reports, in the Log Book, that a hard landing occurred, do the Phase-I inspection immediately. If you find no incorrect condition during the Phase-I inspection, a fly- by of 10 FC (Flight Cycles) not longer than 10 FH (Flight Hours) is permitted. Then you can do one of these two procedures: (a) During the fly-by period, do the Phase-II inspection. In this case, no FDR data analysis is necessary. It will be necessary to do the Phase-III inspection only if you find an incorrect condition during the Phase-II inspection. NOTE: Because the FDR data were not analyzed, you do not know which landing gear had a hard landing. Thus, do the Phase-II inspections on the NLG and on the MLG. (b) During the fly-by period, obey the instructions contained in this section to analyze the FDR data. The Phase-II inspection must then be done only if the data analysis shows that the landing conditions do not obey the threshold limits given in this section for the MLG or NLG touchdown. The Phase-III inspection will be done only if you find an incorrect condition during the Phase-II inspection. NOTE: • The FDR data download must be done within a maximum of 20FH. If not, the data can be missed due to the recording time of the FDR. • The flight data analysis of only one FDR is enough to define whether or not a hard landing has occurred. • FDR is installed in the RH rear fuselage. Open the access door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) When the source for you to find a hard-landing condition is the flight data analysis, not a crew report, the you must do the required inspections as per Figure 601 flow chart. The Phase-III inspection will only be necessary if you find an unsatisfactory condition during the Phase-II inspection. NOTE: • If it is not possible to do Phase-II inspection immediately, a fly-by of 10 FC is granted from the moment of the hard landing detection through the FDR data analysis, provided that the Phase-I inspection is performed immediately and no damage is found during this inspection. • If any discrepancy is found during the Phase-I inspection, the Phase-II inspection must be done immediately. • During the fly-by period, the Phase-II inspection must be done.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Do the analysis of the hard landing separately for the MLG and the NLG. Main-landing gear hard touchdown is a result of a high vertical CG acceleration at the MLG touchdown. The NLG hard touchdown can occur because of a high pitch rate when the nose landing gear touches the runway. (5) When the crew reports that it thinks that there was a possible hard landing, do the analysis for the MLG and for the NLG. (6) Once the hard landing analysis is done separately for the MLG and NLG, the respective inspections that will be necessary also are different, depending on which landing gear was submitted to a hard landing. (7) For the analysis for hard landing, these parameters from the FDR data are necessary ( AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500): • Vertical CG acceleration (normal acceleration) • Pitch angle • Air/Ground indication • Time (GMT) • Date • Flight number (8) If a landing was done out of the temperature envelope, the MLG and NLG hard landing detection procedures are not applicable. Then, go directly to the Phase-II inspection. Do the Phase-III inspection if you find an incorrect condition during the Phase-II inspection. (9) The procedures that we give you here are conservative. Their function is to permit you to find a hard-landing condition and put the related aircraft in a serviceable condition. If you will not do a Phase-III inspection, it is not necessary to send data to Embraer. But, if you must do a Phase-III inspection, send the data to Embraer for analysis (FDR data and a report of the damage found). The decision to put the aircraft back into service will then be made by Embraer together with you. B.

MLG Hard Landing Detection SUBTASK 200-002-A (1) In the FDR data, record the maximum value of vertical CG acceleration in a range that starts 10 seconds before the first transition of the Air/Ground parameter from "Air" to "Ground". Use as a reference to select the 10 seconds the time of the first "ground" recorded for the Air/Ground parameter (Figure 604). (2) Get the aircraft mass at landing. NOTE: • A satisfactory procedure to have an estimate of the aircraft mass at the landing can be used. • When it is not possible to make an estimate of the aircraft mass at landing, use, in a conservative approach, the aircraft mass at the take- off. (3) With the two parameters (Maximum CG acceleration and aircraft mass), refer to Figure 602 to know if a hard landing occurred. (4) If the vertical CG acceleration peak recorded by the FDR at the MLG touchdown is not higher than the vertical CG acceleration permitted for the aircraft mass, no other action is necessary and the aircraft can be put back into service.
