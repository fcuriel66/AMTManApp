CMC Data - MFD Downloading (Figure 201)  (Figure 202)  (Figure 203)  SUBTASK 970-002-A (1) On the main instrument panel, set MFD 1 to maintenance page. NOTE: This page is available only on the ground (WOW) (AMM SDS 32-30-00/1). (a) Push the MFD button. (b) (Applicable to aircraft with FMS) Push the JSTK button. (c) Push the MAINT button. (d) (Applicable to aircraft with -011 CMC and on) A message with the CMC software version comes into view. Push the NEXT button. Result:  1 MFD 1 shows the maintenance page with some maintenance messages. Refer to AMM SDS 45-45-00/1 to see the possible maintenance messages. (2) Examine the maintenance messages. (3) If you want to reset the displayable maintenance messages, do the steps below: (a) (Applicable only to aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-45-0001) Open maintenance panel door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100) to get access to the CMC RESET/ INHIBIT switch. (b) (Applicable only to aircraft POST-MOD SB145-45-0001) Open maintenance panel door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100) to get access to the CMC RESET/ ENABLE switch. NOTE: • On aircraft with -006 CMC installed, this function is available only with the aircraft in flight configuration or with N2 &gt; 50% (engine starting). • To put the aircraft in the flight configuration, on the circuit breaker panel, open the AIR/GND A, AIR/GND B, AIR/GND C, and AIR/GND D circuit breakers. After the displayable maintenance messages are reset, close the four circuit breakers in 10 seconds maximum. • It is possible to reset all the maintenance messages, the displayable and/or the non-displayable messages, with a command from the DAS installed in a personal computer. (c) Set, and hold for 10 seconds, the CMC switch to position RESET. Result:  1 The displayable messages are reset. (d) Close maintenance panel door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). K.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Energize the aircraft with the DC External Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Connect the personal computer (GSE 130), as follows: (a) Open maintenance panel door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (b) With the interconnection cable (GSE 134), connect the personal computer to the CMC maintenance connector as follows: connector P7207 connected to the CMC and connector P4 connected to PC. (4) Make sure that the CMC system (AMM SDS 45-45-00/1) is operational and on. J. CMC Data - Personal Computer Downloading (Figure 204)  SUBTASK 970-003-A (1) Set the personal computer to ON. NOTE: The personal computer must have the Data Acquisition Software (DAS) (GSE 535) available for use. If you have an older DAS software version, refer to GSE 535 in the ITEM to see how the software version is related with the CMC version. (2) For aircraft with -005 or -006 or -007 or -009 CMC installed, do the CMC downloading as follows: (a) Get access to the Data Acquisition Software (DAS) (GSE 535). (b) If you use GSE 331, go to item (4) (c) in this task to do the download. CAUTION: THE DAS CLEAR FUNCTION MUST BE USED ONLY AFTER CMC DOWNLOAD PROCESS, TO CLEAR THE CMC DATA MEMORY. IF IT IS USED BEFORE THE CMC DOWNLOAD PROCESS, ALL CMC DATA WILL BE LOST AND THE CMC DATA DOWNLOAD RESULTS WILL BE EMPTY. (c) NOTE: If the CMC version installed on the aircraft is earlier than version 11, you will not have all the download options available on the GSE 331 software. Select the menu DOWNLOAD to make the download of the data below: • Trend &amp; Exceedance. • Maintenance Messages. • FADEC (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B). NOTE: The DAS permits you to preview the Exceedance and Trend data, and Maint (Maintenance) Messages through the menu PREVIEW, and also to clear them from the CMC Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) through the menu CLEAR. (d) Exit from the DAS. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 970-802-A/200 45-45-00 Page 8 of 13 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>

(4) For aircraft with CMC -011 or higher installed, do the CMC downloading as follows: (a) Get access to the Data Acquisition Software (DAS) (GSE 535). (b) Click on the Start button, select Programs and click on Das.exe. You can also access the Data Acquisition Software (DAS) double-clicking on the "Das CMC EMBRAER" icon on the Windows desktop. NOTE: These are standard procedures to get access to the Data Acquisition Software. If DAS was installed in a different location, or your Windows environment is not in English, do the applicable steps to get access to the DAS application. (c) Make sure that the DAS recognizes the CMC-011 version or higher installed in the aircraft. To do this, check if the version number reported on the CMC Version field of the DAS Selection window matches the CMC version installed on the aircraft. NOTE: For aircraft with CMC-011 or higher installed, if a "CMC Version" dialog box comes into view with the "No version found" information, check the CMC connection to the PC. (d) On the DAS Selection window, click on the FULL DAS button. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 970-802-A/200 45-45-00 Page 10 of 13 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
