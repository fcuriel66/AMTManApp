			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TOWING - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the task for aircraft towing. Aircraft towing operations are only possible with the aid of a power equipment, preferably equipped with fluid drive transmission. B. The recommended towbar attachment head GSE 009 has a shear pin that breaks with a load of more than 4,418 kg (9,740 lb) (tension compression shear) or 4,300 N.m (38,053 lb.in) (Radial shear). This prevents damage to the landing gear or the aircraft structure if an excessive load occurs. C. Figure 201 shows the ground towing factors that are most important in different conditions. You can find the necessary towbar and the total wheel-traction load with these data: aircraft weight, pavement slope, coefficient of friction, and engine idle thrust. The example of the figure shows an aircraft gross weight of 17,000 kg (37,477 lb) and two engines with flight idle thrust. For a pavement of wet asphalt with a 2% slope, the tractor total wheel-traction load will be 1,750 kg (3,858 lb) and the towbar load will be 1,300 kg (2,866 lb) (Example A). If the towing is rearward without idle thrust or with ground idle thrust, these numbers change as follows: 1,125 kg (2,480 lb) of tractor total wheel-traction load and 850 kg (1,874 lb) of towbar load (Example B). D. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: WHEN YOU TOW THE AIRCRAFT, ALL PEOPLE MUST STAY OUT OF THE DANGEROUS AREAS AROUND THE TOW TRACTOR, NOSE WHEEL, MAIN WHEELS AND AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE AND WINGS. PEOPLE ON GROUND CAN BE RUN OVER BY NOSE WHEEL, MAIN WHEELS, TOW TRACTOR AND AIRCRAFT FUSELAGE AND WINGS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE AIRCRAFT WILL CHANGE POSITION DURING PUSHBACK AND TOWING. OBEY SAFE DISTANCE BETWEEN PEOPLE ON GROUND AND THE EQUIPMENT THAT MOVES. A FATAL INJURY CAN OCCUR. CAUTION: • TOW THE AIRCRAFT ONLY WITH A TOWBAR SPECIFIED IN ITEM ITEM GSE 008 AND ITEM ITEM GSE 009. ALTERNATIVE DEVICES CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT. • DURING TOWING OPERATIONS, A TECHNICIAN MUST STAY IN THE COCKPIT TO SET THE EMERGENCY/PARKING BRAKE, PULLING THE EMERGENCY/ PARKING BRAKE HANDLE (DET. A, FIGURE 202) AS NECESSARY. EXCEPT FOR THE CASE THE AIRCRAFT IS MOVED WITH NO BRAKE SYSTEM AVAILABLE, ON THE REPAIR FACILITIES, TOWING MUST BE DONE WITH PERSONNEL READY, STANDING BY WITH CHOCKS FOR EMERGENCY USE. • DURING THE TOWING OPERATIONS WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM ENERGIZED, MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRIC MOTOR-DRIVEN HYDRAULIC PUMPS ARE OFF. • REMOVE ALL TOOLS, EQUIPMENT, AND MATERIALS FROM THE TOWING AREA. MAKE SURE THAT THE AREA IS CLEAN. • TO PREVENT PEAK LOADS, MAKE SURE THAT ACCELERATION AND DECELERATIONS DURING TOWING ARE SMOOTH. POWER EQUIPMENT THAT IS EQUIPPED WITH FLUID DRIVE TRANSMISSION HELPS TO PREVENT PEAK LOADS. • DO NOT MOVE OR TOW THE AIRCRAFT OUT OF THE HANGAR WITH FUEL TANK ACCESS PANELS OPEN. IF YOU DO THIS, CONTAMINATION CAN OCCUR IN THE FUEL TANK AND SOME DAMAGE CAN OCCUR TO THE FUEL SYSTEM AND ITS COMPONENTS. (1) Make sure that the safety pins of the landing gear are correctly installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). NOTE: The use of the safety pins on MLG and NLG is optional when you tow or push the aircraft for the flight. This occurs when the aircraft is in position for the flight crew to taxi the aircraft before or after a flight. (2) For aircraft with winglets, make sure that the winglet covers (GSE 259) are applied. (3) Check the correct ground towing requirements on the Ground Towing Requirements chart (Figure 201) so as to size your tow tractor appropriately according to the aircraft.

A, Figure 202) and with the aircraft energized make sure that the "brake on" lights (DET. B and DET. D, Figure 202) are on. NOTE: To prevent hydraulic fluid transference from system 1 to system 2 or vice- versa, first apply brakes with the pedals and then pull or release the emergency/parking brake handle. (a) For the case the aircraft is moved with no brake system available on the repair facilities, towing must be done with personnel ready, standing by with chocks for emergency use. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, open the STEER circuit and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. On aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0057, alternatively set the external steering disengagement switch to the "DISENGAGED" position (DET. E and DET. F, Figure 202). Make sure that the "STEER INOP" message comes into view on the EICAS display. (6) On the circuit breaker panel, open the INTEG STBY circuit breaker (Location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/INTEG STBY) and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. J. Towing (Figure 201)  (Figure 202)  SUBTASK 580-002-A (1) Remove the lock pin from the guide pin on towbar assembly GSE 008 and GSE 009 (Figure 202). (2) Make sure that the shear pin of GSE 009 (VIEW C) is in good condition. If there is a sheared shear pin, do a visual inspection and change the shear pin according to the vendors documentation. (3) Install towbar assembly GSE 008 and GSE 009 on the nose landing gear. (4) Put the guide pin in the towing attachment of the nose landing gear. (5) Lock the guide pin with the lock pin. (6) Install the other end of towbar assembly GSE 008 and GSE 009 to the tow tractor. (7) Make sure that tires are in a serviceable condition. If necessary, do the check and charging of tires, refer to AMM TASK 32-49-01-600-801-A/300 for the main wheel tires and AMM TASK 32-49-04-600-801-A/300 for the nose wheel tires. (8) Remove the wheel chocks (GSE 012). CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE EMERGENCY/PARKING BRAKE IS RELEASED AND, WITH THE AIRCRAFT ENERGIZED, MAKE SURE THAT THE "BRAKE ON" LIGHTS (DET. B AND DET. D, FIGURE 202) ARE OFF. (9) Release the emergency/parking brake. Set the emergency/parking brake handle to the down position (DET. A).
