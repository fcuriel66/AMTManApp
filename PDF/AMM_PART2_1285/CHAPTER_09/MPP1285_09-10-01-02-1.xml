			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: To prevent hydraulic fluid transference from system 1 to system 2 or vice versa, first apply brakes with the pedals and then pull or release the emergency/parking brake handle. WARNING: OBEY THE MAXIMUM LIFT LIMIT (140 mm / 5.5 in) AND DO NOT LIFT THE AIRCRAFT PARTIALLY DISASSEMBLED. IF YOU LIFT THE NOSEWHEEL TOO HIGH, IT CAN CAUSE A CHANGE IN THE AIRCRAFT CENTER OF GRAVITY AND CAUSE THE AIRCRAFT TO TIP ON ITS TAIL. (10) Make sure that the area around the aircraft is clean. Lift the nosewheel cradle of the tug. CAUTION: • DO NOT TOW THE AIRCRAFT AT MORE THAN 24 KM/H (15 MPH). • DO NOT PUSH-BACK THE AIRCRAFT AT MORE THAN THE 8 KM/H (5 MPH). • GOOD COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TOWING TRACTOR OPERATOR AND THE COCKPIT PERSON MUST BE ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT IS TOWED. • USE THE AIRCRAFT BRAKES TO STOP THE AIRCRAFT ONLY WHEN THERE IS A RISK OF COLLISION OR DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT. GIVE THE TRACTOR OPERATOR A WARNING THAT YOU WILL BRAKE THE AIRCRAFT. • DO NOT OVERSTEER. THE MAXIMUM TOWING ANGLE IS 170ÃÂ° TO THE RIGHT AND 170ÃÂ° TO THE LEFT. IF YOU USE MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM TOWING ANGLE, DO A VISUAL INSPECTION ON NOSE LANDING GEAR. IF A PART IS DAMAGED, REPAIR OR REPLACE IT AS APPLICABLE. • DURING THE TOWING PROCEDURE, DO NOT BRAKE THE AIRCRAFT. INDEPENDENTLY OF THE SPEED, THIS CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE AND/OR TO THE NOSE LANDING GEAR. NOTE: • Start and stop with the nose landing gear as near to the 0ÃÂ° position as possible. • For longer distances, the aircraft towing is usually done with the tug in reverse, while the aircraft is pulled. But not always, this is the best procedure to do the task. • You will usually drive the tug forward and push the aircraft for the final positioning of the aircraft in a hangar or at ramp services. Make sure that you obeyed all the steps before this and do as follows: (a) Tow the aircraft slowly straight ahead before you turn. (b) If, during the towing procedure, the aircraft is braked, independently of the speed, check the nose landing gear and its adjacent structure for possible damage.
