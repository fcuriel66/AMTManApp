(b) Set the NAV light switch, on the overhead panel, to the OFF position. Result: 1 The main LH-wing navigation light goes off. 2 The main RH-wing navigation light goes off. 3 The tail navigation lights go off. (2) For aircraft with standby tail navigation lights do the test of the main navigation lights as follows (Figure 501) (Figure 503): (a) Open the access 272BR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (b) Make sure that the STBY NAV LT switch, on the ramp hail panel, is in the NORM position. (c) Set the NAV light switch, on the overhead panel, to the ON position. Result: 1 The main LH-wing navigation light, on the left-wing-tip fairing, comes on. 2 The main RH-wing navigation light, on the right-wing-tip fairing, comes on. 3 The tail navigation lights, on the fin-tip fairing, come on. (d) Set the NAV light switch, on the overhead panel, to the OFF position. Result: 1 The main LH-wing navigation light goes off. 2 The main RH-wing navigation light goes off. 3 The tail navigation lights go off. (e) Close the access 272BR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) For aircraft without standby tail navigation lights do the test of the standby navigation lights as follows (Figure 501) (Figure 502): (a) Get access to the maintenance panel ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (b) Set the STBY NAV LT switch, on the maintenance panel, to the STBY position. (c) Set the NAV LT switch, on the overhead panel, to the ON position. Result: 1 The standby LH-wing navigation light, on the left-wing-tip fairing, comes on. 2 The standby RH-wing navigation light, on the right-wing-tip fairing, comes on. 3 The tail navigation lights, on the fin-tip fairing, come on. (d) Set the NAV light switch, on the overhead panel, to the OFF position. Result: 1 The standby LH-wing navigation light goes off. 2 The standby RH-wing navigation light goes off.
