			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 402) (Figure 403) (Figure 404) (Figure 405)  SUBTASK 420-003-A CAUTION: • EXAMINE THE LAMP HOLDER FOR DAMAGE. IF IT IS DAMAGED, REPLACE THE HOLDER. • MAKE SURE THAT AFTER YOU PUT THE LAMP IN POSITION, THE TWO ENDS OF THE LAMP ARE HELD AND LOCKED IN THE LAMP HOLDER, THE LAMP CONTACT POINTS ARE BELLOW THE LAMP HOLDER WHILE THE CONTACT LOCKS AND THE LAMP IS CENTERED BETWEEN THE LAMP HOLDER. IF NOT, THERE WILL NOT BE A GOOD CONTACT AND PREMATURE LAMP BURN-OUT OR LAMP FAILURE CAN OCCUR. • MAKE SURE THAT THE SPRINGS IN THE LAMP HOLDER MOVE BACK TO THEIR NORMAL POSITION AFTER THE LAMP IS PUT INTO POSITION. THIS WILL HELP THE LAMP MAKE GOOD CONTACT WITH THE LAMP HOLDER AND THE LAMP CONTACTS WILL NOT COME AWAY FROM THE LAMP HOLDER. (A SMALL MIRROR CAN BE USED TO INSPECT FOR CORRECT LAMP INSTALLATION). (1) Refer to figure 402 and install the passenger-cabin-sidewall fluorescent lamps as follows: (a) Push and hold the lamp holder pushbutton (3) to install the fluorescent lamp (4). (b) Adjust the fluorescent lamp (4) in the correct position and push the electrical contact at one end of the fluorescent lamp (4) against the lamp holder, then carefully engage the other end of the fluorescent lamp (4) and release the lamp holder pushbutton (3). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU INSTALL THE DEFLECTOR ASSEMBLY TO PREVENT PARTIAL DISENGAGEMENT OF THE LAMP FROM THE LAMP HOLDER. (c) Install the deflector assembly (2). (2) Refer to figure 403 and install the passenger-cabin-sidewall fluorescent lamps as follows: (a) Put the manual deploy tool (1) in the hole of the lamp holder to install the fluorescent lamp (4). (b) Adjust the fluorescent lamp (4) in the correct position and push the electrical contact at one end of the fluorescent lamp (4) against the lamp holder, then carefully engage the other end of the fluorescent lamp (4) and and pull the manual deploy tool (1). NOTE: If the red tab indicators are visible, push the ends of the lamp against the lamp holder. The red tabs will retract out of view when the ends of the lamp are held and locked in the lamp holders.
