			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Operationally Test Galley Lights (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 710-002-A EFFECTIVITY: FOR AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD S.B. 145-33-0015 (1) Do the test of the Galley lights as follows: NOTE: The DIM mode function will not be operational, if you have applied PART I of S.B.145-33-0040. (a) On the galley control panel, push the galley light ON/OFF switch to set it to the ON position. Result: 1 The galley lights come on. (b) On the galley control panel, push the galley light BRT/DIM switch to set it to the BRT position. Result: 1 The galley lights are set to full brightness. (c) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH BALLAST PN BR9000-2 AND BR9000-4) On the galley control panel, toggle the BRT/DIM switch six times to reset the ballast. Result: 1 The galley lights go off after the sixth time that they change to BRT mode. (d) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH BALLAST PN BR9000-22 AND BR9000-30) On the galley control panel, toggle the BRT/DIM switch twelve times to reset the ballast. Result: 1 The galley lights go off after the twelfth time that they change to BRT mode. (e) On the galley control panel, push the galley light BRT/DIM switch to set it to the DIM position. Result: 1 The galley lights are set to reduced brightness. (f) On the galley control panel, push the galley light ON/OFF switch to set it to the OFF position. Result: 1 The galley lights go off. K. Operationally Test Galley Lights (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 710-003-A EFFECTIVITY: FOR AIRCRAFT POST-MOD S.B. 145-33-0015 (1) Do the test of the Galley lights as follows: NOTE: The DIM mode function will not be operational, if you have applied PART I of S.B.145-33-0040.
