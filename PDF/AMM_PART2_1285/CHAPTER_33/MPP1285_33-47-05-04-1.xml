Installation (Figure 401)  (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-006-A EFFECTIVITY: FOR ACFT WITH CIRCULAR RED BEACON (1) Make sure that the aircraft is in the same configuration as it was at the end of the removal task ( AMM TASK 33-47-05-000-801-A/400). (2) Install the red beacon light assembly (5) as follows (Figure 401): (a) (PRE-MOD S.B.145-33-0006) If the red beacon light assembly is installed on the wing/fuselage fairing, make sure that the drain screw (3) is removed and the stickers are punched. This is to drain possible water collected in the red beacon light assembly. If the red beacon light assembly is installed on the top of the fuselage, make sure that the drain screw (3) is installed and that the stickers are not damaged and in position. This is to prevent the entrance of water in the assembly. (b) Do the bonding procedure, by method 3 (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200), between the red beacon light and their attaching points on the structure. NOTE: The red beacon must bond electrically to the aircraft structure. You must remove all contamination, debris, or fluids from the bonding surfaces before installation. (c) Apply the approved sealant on the faying surface on the structure where the red beacon light assembly (5) will be installed (SRM 51-20-01/1). (d) Install the gasket (6). CAUTION: DO NOT TOUCH THE ELECTRICAL PINS OF THE CONNECTORS. DAMAGE CAN OCCUR TO THE INTERNAL ESDS COMPONENTS. (e) Remove the ESD protective cap from the electrical connector (1). (f) Connect the electrical connector (1). (g) Put the light assembly (5) in position and attach it with the screws (2). (h) Apply the approved sealant (7) along the support base of the red beacon light (SRM 51-20-01/1). SUBTASK 420-006-B EFFECTIVITY: FOR ACFT WITH AERODYNAMIC RED BEACON (3) Make sure that the aircraft is in the same configuration as it was at the end of the removal task ( AMM TASK 33-47-05-000-801-A/400). (4) If you removed the red- beacon light assembly (4) with adapter plate (15), Install as follows, refer to Figure 402, detail A and B: CAUTION: DO NOT USE METAL BRUSHES, METAL SCRAPERS, CHIPCHASERS, PICKS, SCREWDRIVERS, BLADES, STEEL WOOL, OR ABRASIVES TO REMOVE SEALANTS AND PAINT. THESE TOOLS CAN CAUSE SCRATCHES AND CRACKS AND, AS A RESULT, SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT CAN OCCUR.
