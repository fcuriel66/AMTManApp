			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 33-51-01-700-802-A EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH RECHARGEABLE FLASHLIGHT 2. FLASHLIGHTS - FUNCTIONAL CHECK A. General (1) For this task, you must do a check of the flashlight assembly and do a test of the battery pack. When the flashlight is on the cradle, its battery is automatically charged. To do the test of the battery pack, it is necessary to charge it to full capacity before and after the test, before you put the battery back to service. It is possible to do this task on the workbench or on the aircraft. It is important to know that this functional check takes a minimum of 25 hours, on the workbench or on the aircraft. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-006-A (1) Make sure that the battery pack is charged to full capacity before the test. NOTE: You must charged the battery for a minimum of 24 hours to make sure that the battery pack is charged to full capacity. J. Flashlight Functional Check (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-004-A EFFECTIVITY: AIRCRAFT WITH RECHARGEABLE FLASHLIGHT (1) To do the functional check of the flashlight assembly on the workbench, do as follows: (a) Remove the flashlight assembly ( AMM TASK 33-50-16-000-801-A/400). NOTE: It is possible to put other flashlight assembly in conditions for flight in place ( AMM TASK 33-50-16-400-801-A/400). (b) Refer to the last revision of CMM 25-60-11 (DME Corporation) to do the functional check of the flashlight assembly. NOTE: In the CMM 25-60-11 (DME Corporation) the flashlight assembly is identified as flashlight system. (2) To do the functional check of the flashlight assembly in the airplane, do as follows: (a) Pull the flashlight (5), bottom first, off the cradle (3). (b) Make sure that the cradle (3) is tight and attached to the structure. (c) Make sure that the battery (7) has no electrolyte leakage, swelling, bulging, or signs of corrosion of exposed metal. (d) Turn on the flashlight (5) and do as follows: 1 Make sure that the battery will supply a minimum of 30 minutes of useful light. NOTE: The term useful light means that the intensity of the flashlight system is sufficient to do the tasks and/or jobs in which the flashlight is necessary (no measurement is necessary). 2 Discharge the battery (keep it on). 3 Replace the battery if it does not supply 30 minutes of useful light. (e) Set the flashlight to off. (f) Examine the O-rings (4) for cracks, nicks or other signs of damage. (g) Examine all wires (6) in the battery compartment. (h) Remove the flashlight assembly ( AMM TASK 33-50-16-000-801-A/400). 1 Examine the open wires external to the bracket and the open wires external to the system (open/free the wiring between the bracket and the electrical EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-802-A/500 33-51-01 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Wires that were immobilized in wire bundles it is not necessary to examine. 2 Examine all electrical connectors (2) for signs of too much wear or damage. 3 Examine the flashlight (5) and cradle (3) for signs of overheating or material damage (nicks, cracks, abrasions). (i) Install the flashlight assembly to the aircraft ( AMM TASK 33-50-16-400-801-A/ 400). (j) Charge the serviceable battery for a minimum of 24 hours before you put the battery back to service.

General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the functional check of the flashlight. (2) The electronic monitoring circuit in the flashlight body gives an indication of battery pack readiness and lamp integrity through a flashing light-emitting diode (LED), on the head of the flashlight. The LED flashes at regular intervals. Flashing intervals longer than 5 seconds are a sign of low battery power. B.
