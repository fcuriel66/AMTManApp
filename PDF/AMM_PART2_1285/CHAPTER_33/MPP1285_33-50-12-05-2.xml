(c) Let the cabin have the minimum permitted lighting conditions for maintenance as follows, primarily in the areas with minimum lighting. Put off 10% of the total quantity of lights. Refer to AMM TASK 33-21-06-000-802-A/400. 1. The overhead ceiling and sidewall lighting can contain off lights. But there must not be more than 10 percent of the total quantity. No more than two adjacent lamps in the longitudinal or lateral direction can be off. All off lamps must be clear of galley, cabinets, and life-raft storage areas. 2. All lamps in the liferaft storage areas must be on. 3. Overhead lighting at the forward and aft cabin doors must operate in the ‘BRIGHT’ setting. (d) Write down the minimum lighting level in the same table. NOTE: Before you do this step, do the Preparation again (refer to SUBTASK 33-50-12-841-002-A00). (e) Put the lighting equipment in the original configuration (to install the removed light lamps back, refer to AMM TASK 33-21-06-400-802-A/400). (f) Make sure that all of the averages are more than 20 LUX. (2) Measure the emergency exit illumination as follows: (a) Set all interior lights to the off position and completely mask all self-luminous signs on the overwing hatches, overhead markings, and bulkhead markings. NOTE: Do not mask the exit markings. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-802-A/500 CONFIG-2 33-50-12 Page 9 of 14 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Hold the light meter sensor base against the exit panels to measure light on the exit. Write down the measurements in the Table 503. NOTE: • A small penlight can be necessary to read the meter. • Do not shade the meter probe while you take readings.
