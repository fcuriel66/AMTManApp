			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) For aircraft POST-MOD. SB145-32-0036, install the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (3) Make sure that the landing-gear safety pins are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (4) Lift the nose landing gear on a jack (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-803-A/200). (5) Turn each of the nose wheels by hand. Make sure that you can turn the wheels without the use of excessive force and that there is no roughness or noise. (6) Use your hands to apply a push/pull force to the top side of each wheel and make sure that there is no apparent axial play between the axle and the wheel bearings. NOTE: Problems found in steps (5) and (6) are possibly a sign of failure of the bearings (2) and (8). J. Removal (Figure 401)  (Figure 402)  (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: WE RECOMMEND YOU TO ALWAYS DEFLATE THE TIRE BEFORE YOU REMOVE THE WHEEL/TIRE ASSEMBLY. BUT, WHEN YOU MUST REMOVE IT ONLY TO GET ACCESS TO OTHER COMPONENTS, YOU CAN REMOVE THE TIRE INFLATED IF: • THE TIRE IS NOT DAMAGED • THE TIRE IS WITH THE CORRECT OPERATION PRESSURE.   DO NOT WORK WITH HOT TIRES TO PREVENT INJURY. (1) Deflate the tire. (2) Remove the cotter pin (7). (3) Remove the nut (6), washer (5), and bolt (3). (4) Remove the wheel nut (4). (5) Remove the outer seal (Fig. 402, item 13; Fig. 403, item 12) or the integrated seal/ water deflector shield or water deflector shield (11), as applicable. NOTE: Make sure that the seals, water deflectors, and bearings are sent together with the wheel assembly to the shop for inspection as written in BF GOODRICH CMM 32-49-04. (6) Remove the outer cone bearing (Fig. 401, item 2; Fig. 402, item 2; Fig. 403, item 2) or outer cone and seal assembly bearing (Fig 404, item 2) as applicable. (7) Remove the outer cup bearing (Fig. 404, item 12) as applicable. CAUTION: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU REMOVE THE NOSE WHEELS FROM THE AXLE, NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE CHROMIUM-PLATED AND CADMIUM-PLATED SURFACES OF THE AXLE. FOR THE REPAIR PROCEDURE, IF NECESSARY, REFER TO AMM TASK 32-20-08-200-801-A/ 600. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 32-49-05 Page 3 of 12 Rev 50 - Apr 29/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation (Figure 401) (Figure 402) (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 841-003-A CAUTION: USE ONLY MOBIL AVIATION GREASE SHC100. DO NOT MIX DIFFERENT BRANDS OF GREASE. (1) Make sure that the bearings of the wheel assembly (1) are completely lubricated (filled with grease). Refer to CMM 32-49-04. NOTE: EMBRAER recommends that you install tires of the same brand to prevent possible vibration.   (2) Clean the wheel axle (9) with cleaning solvent. (3) Lubricate the threads and the chromium-plated area of the wheel axle (9) with Mobil Aviation Grease SHC100. J. Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402) (Figure 403) (Figure 404)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION: • THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT WHEEL ASSY SEAL CONFIGURATIONS, WHICH ARE SHOWN IN FIGURES 401, 402, 403 AND 404. MAKE SURE THAT ONLY ONE CONFIGURATION ASSEMBLY IS INSTALLED ON EACH WHEEL. IF NECESSARY, REFER TO FIGURE 401, 402, 403 OR 404. IF YOU ADD MORE WATER DEFLECTORS AND/OR SEALS THAN SPECIFIED, THEY CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE NOSE WHEEL ASSEMBLY. • MAKE SURE THAT THE WHEEL BEARINGS AND THE SEALS ARE SERVICEABLE BEFORE THE WHEEL INSTALLATION. • BE CAREFUL TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE BEARINGS DURING THE WHEEL INSTALLATION. • BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU INSTALL THE NOSE WHEELS ON THE AXLE, NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE CHROMIUM-PLATED AND CADMIUM-PLATED SURFACES OF THE AXLE. NOTE: Make sure that the axle sleeve (10) is installed on the wheel axle (9). (1) For nose wheel assembly equipped with integrated seal/water deflector shield on the inboard and outboard sides (Figure 401): (a) Install the integrated seal/water deflector shield (11) in the correct position. Refer to DET. C and DET. D. (b) Install the inner cone bearing (8) on the wheel axle (9). (c) Put the wheel assembly (1) on the wheel axle (9). NOTE: Make sure that the tire valve is on the outer side. (d) Install the outer cone bearing (2) and the integrated seal/water deflector shield (11) on the wheel axle (9). Refer to DET. C and DET. D.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) For nose wheel assembly equipped with water deflector shield only on the inboard side and separate from the seal (Figure 402): (a) Install the water deflector shield (11) in the correct position. Refer to DET. B. (b) Install the inner seal (12) and inner cone bearing (8) on the wheel axle (9). (c) Put the wheel assembly (1) on the wheel axle (9). NOTE: Make sure that the tire valve is on the outer side. (d) Install the outer cone bearing (2) and the outer seal (13) on the wheel axle (9). (3) For nose wheel assembly not equipped with water deflector shield (Figure 403): (a) Install the inner seal (11) and inner cone bearing (8) on the wheel axle (9). (b) Put the wheel assembly (1) on the wheel axle (9). NOTE: Make sure that the tire valve is on the outer side. (c) Install the outer cone bearing (2) and the outer seal (12) on the wheel axle (9). (4) For nose wheel assembly equipped with /water deflector shield on the inboard and outboard sides (Figure 404): (a) Install the water deflector shield (11) in the correct position. Refer to DET. C and DET. D. (b) Install the inner cone and seal assembly bearing (8) on the wheel axle (9). (c) Install the inner cone bearing (12) on the wheel axle (9). (d) Put the wheel assembly (1) on the wheel axle (9). NOTE: Make sure that the tire valve is on the outer side. (e) Install the outer cone bearing (12) outer cone and seal assembly bearing (2) and the water deflector shield (11) on the wheel axle (9). Refer to DET. C and DET. D. (5) Install the wheel nut (4) and turn it manually until it touches the outer cone bearing (2). (6) Tighten the wheel nut (4) and apply a torque of 33.9 N.m (300 lb.in), while you turn the wheel. Turn the wheel assembly (1) in the same direction as that in which the wheel nut (4) is tightened. NOTE: This procedure is to prevent possible gaps. (7) Release the torque on the wheel nut (4) to zero. (8) Apply a torque of 16.3 N.m (150 lb.in) to the wheel nut (4), in only one continuous turn, while you turn the wheel. Turn the wheel assembly (1) in the same direction as that in which the wheel nut (4) is tightened. NOTE: This procedure will prevent incorrect indication of the break-away torque that will occur when the turning of the nut stops and starts again.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (9) Install the bolt (3), washer (5), nut (6), and cotter pin (7). If necessary, continue to tighten the wheel nut (4) up to a torque of 39.5 N.m (350 lb.in) maximum to make the holes align to permit the bolt (3) installation. (10) Make sure that you can turn the wheel manually on the wheel axle (9). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Lower the aircraft and remove the jack (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-804-A/200). (2) For aircraft POST-MOD. SB145-32-0036, remove the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (3) Do a check on the tire for operational pressure ( AMM TASK 32-49-04-600-801-A/300). (4) Remove the safety pins of the landing gear ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200) before the taxi and take-off.
