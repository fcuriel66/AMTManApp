			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: To prevent hydraulic fluid transference from system 1 to system 2 or vice versa, first apply brakes with the pedals and then pull or release the emergency/parking brake handle. (3) For aircraft PRE-MOD SB 145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No. 1 is fully released AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200. (4) For aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-32-0036, install safety pin of the NLG doors solenoid valve AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200. (5) Make sure that the landing-gear safety pins are installed AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200. J. Visual Inspection of the Brake Assembly for General Conditions SUBTASK 212-002-A (1) For aircraft with brake assembly that have two bleeder valves do as follows: (a) Examine the brake assembly for external leakage through the bleeder valves (1) and bleeder plugs (2). Refer to Figure 601. (2) For aircraft with brake assembly that have four bleeder valves do as follows: (a) Examine the brake assembly for external leakage through the bleeder valves (1). Refer to Figure 602. (3) Examine the brake assembly for external leakage through the pistons (2). Refer to Figure 603. (4) Examine the piston housing (3) for visual cracks. Refer to Figure 603. (5) Visually examine each brake shuttle valve assembly (4) for hydraulic fluid leakage or cracks. Refer to Figure 603. (6) Examine the lock pin (1) that attaches the brake assembly to the leg of the main landing gear for general condition. Refer to Figure 603. (7) Operate the emergency/parking brake handle and do a visual check to make sure that all the pistons (2) of the brake assembly operate correctly. Refer to Figure 603. (8) If one or more of the piston(s) (2) do(es) not come out from the piston housing (3), replace the brake assembly ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-000-801-A/400 ) and ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-400-801-A/400). Refer to Figure 603. (9) If the wheel is removed, visually inspect: NOTE: Make sure that the emergency/parking brake handle is released (brakes off).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (d) The torque button, insulator, tie bolts, nuts, and washers for general conditions. K. Detailed Inspection of the Brake Wear Indicator (Figure 603)  SUBTASK 220-002-A (1) Make sure that the emergency/parking brake handle is set and do a visual check to make sure that all the pistons (2) of the brake assembly are operated. NOTE: Do the check of the brake wear-indicator positions with the brake applied (brakes on). (2) Examine the brake wear indicators (6) for visual cracks. NOTE: If the wear pin is missing, do the AMM TASK 32-49-03-200-803-A/600 to inspect if the pressure plate is oxidized. (3) Examine the brake wear-indicator length. When the indicator rod is flat with the hexagonal insert, the brakes are fully worn and must be replaced ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-000-801-A/400 ) and ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-400-801-A/400). (4) If the brake wear indicators (6) do not come out from the wear indicator sleeve (5), replace the related brake assembly ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-000-801-A/400 ) and ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-400-801-A/400). NOTE: The brake is fully worn when the end of a wear indicator pin (6) is flush with a wear indicator sleeve (5). L. Follow on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Make sure that the emergency/parking brake handle is set (brakes on). (2) Remove the chocks from the landing gears wheels. (3) For aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-32-0036, remove the safety pin from the NLG doors solenoid valve AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200.

Refer to Figure 605 - sheet 2 - det C. d Pressure plate surface around the pistons and insulators for any signs of oxidation, fraying, indentations, or soft spots. Refer to Figure 605 - sheet 6. e With the brakes released, the piston insulator (cap) will move slightly. Using the pick, scratch slightly under the insulator to ensure there is no ridge or groove from the insulator digging into the pressure plate. Refer to Figure 605 - sheet 6. 2 Normal wear can occur at the edges of the carbon disks from the friction surface to the non friction surfaces. Normal wear is less than 1/8 inches (3,1mm) wide around the circumference of the two friction and non-friction surfaces (corners). Refer to Figure 605 - sheet 5 - det G and FF. a Replace the brake assembly ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-000-801-A/400) and ( AMM TASK 32-49-03-400-801-A/400) if the wear is more than 1/8 inches (3,1mm) wide.
