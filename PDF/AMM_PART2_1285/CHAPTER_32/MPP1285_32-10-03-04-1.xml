Preparation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Before you start the assembly, make sure that the articulation nut and bearing are in the correct position according to flight direction for the aircraft side it will be installed. Refer to Figure 401, DET. B and C. (a) If necessary, invert the articulation nut as follows: 1 Remove and discard cotter-pin (15). 2 Remove the nut (16) and washer (17) from the axle (19). 3 Remove the axle (19) and bushing (18) from the main brace strut (11). 4 Apply corrosion-inhibiting compound (COR-BAN 27L) to the bushing (18) and axle (19). 5 Install the bushing (18) and axle (19) on the main brace strut (11) in the opposite direction that they were removed. 6 Install the washer (17) and nut (16) on the axle (19). 7 Apply a torque of 45 to 57 N.m (400 to 500 lbf.in) to the nut (16). 8 Safety the nut (16) with the cotter-pin (15). 9 Remove the unwanted corrosion-inhibiting compound from the surfaces with a lint-free cloth moist with Rhodiasolve E-23.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402) (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION: Before you start the assembly, make sure that the bearings and articulation nut are in the correct position in the brace strut. Refer to Figure 401, DET. B and C. (1) Do steps (a) thru (g) only if you must remove the main brace strut bearings or if you will change the Aeroshell 22 grease for Aeroshell 33 grease or vice versa. If not, go to step (2). (a) Use a dry lint-free cloth to remove the remaining grease from the main brace strut bearings and bearing housing. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE SOLVENT GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (b) With a cloth soaked in Rhodiasolve E-23, clean the remaining grease from the related area as necessary. CAUTION: AEROSHELL GREASE 22 MUST NOT BE MIXED WITH AEROSHELL GREASE 33. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, THE MIXTURE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENTS. (c) After cleaning, apply Aeroshell Grease 22 to the inner surface of the bearing housing. Refer to Figure 403. NOTE: You can use alternative grease Aeroshell 33. (d) Record the grease used in the applicable document. (e) Install the main brace strut bearings in their housings. (f) Fill the bearing with the same grease through the lubrication fitting at the bottom of the bearing housing until the grease comes out from the bearing. (g) Apply sealant PR 1440 B2 along the contour of the two sides of the main brace strut bearings. Refer to (Figure 403). (2) Put the main brace strut (11) in position between the MLG leg strut and the support at the wing structure. (3) Apply corrosion-inhibiting compound (COR-BAN 27L) to the hollow pin (12) and install it to attach the top end of the main brace strut (11) to the support at the wing structure. (4) Align the hole of the main brace strut (11) and the hole of the hollow pin (12) and install the bolt (14) (with corrosion-inhibiting compound - COR-BAN 27L), washer (1), and nut (2). (5) Put the cardan joint (4) on the hollow pin (12) with corrosion-inhibiting compound (COR-BAN 27L) and install the washer (5) and locking washer (6). (6) Put the bottom end of the main brace strut (11) on the MLG leg and install the special bolt (10) (with corrosion-inhibiting compound - COR-BAN 27L), and nut (9).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Apply a torque of 45 to 57 N.m (400 to 500 lb.in) to the nut (9). (7) Install the cotter pins (3) and (8). (8) Do a check of the clearance between the bearings and bushing surface of the main brace strut (see (Figure 402) as follows: (a) Manually push the main brace strut forward. (b) Use the feeler gage to measure the clearance. Refer to (Figure 402). (c) The clearance must be between 0.1 and 1.30 mm (0.004 and 0.051 in). (9) Apply sealant PR 1440 B2 to the locking washer (6) and nut (9). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 843-002-A (1) Install the MLG actuator (AMM TASK 32-33-08-000-801-A/400). (2) Connect the lower end of the auxiliary brace strut (AMM TASK 32-10-04-000-801-A/ 400). (3) Install the unlocking actuator (AMM TASK 32-33-09-000-801-A/400). (4) Connect the bonding strap end to the main brace strut (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801- A/200). (5) Lubricate the main brace strut ( AMM TASK 32-34-00-600-801-A/300) with the same grease as in the installation. (6) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the ELEC PUMP 1 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (7) Energize the aircraft. (8) Remove the safety pins from the landing gears. (9) Retract and extend the landing gear ( AMM TASK 32-30-00-700-801-A/500). (10) Do the functional check of the landing gear free-fall system ( AMM TASK 32-34-00-700-801-A/500). (11) Lower the aircraft and remove the jacks (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-802-A/200). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 32-10-03 Page 10 of 10 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
