			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL PRESSURE TRANSDUCER - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures for removal/installation and deactivation/reactivation of the pressure transducer. B. This procedure is applicable to the four pressure transducers (two for the outboard brakes and two for the inboard brakes) installed two in the LH wing stub and two in the RH wing stub. C. The pressure transducers of the outboard and the inboard brakes of the LH main landing gear are installed in the LH wing. D. The pressure transducers of the outboard and the inboard brakes of the RH main landing gear are installed in the RH wing. E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Remove access panel 532AB or panel 632AB ( AMM MPP 06-44-00/100). (3) Control the rudder to the left and to the right until the pressure of the hydraulic system shows zero PSI on the EICAS. (4) Fully release the pressure from the fluid chamber of the emergency/parking brake system hydraulic accumulator ( AMM TASK 32-44-02-910-801-A/200). (5) Slowly open the charging valve of the nitrogen chamber of the hydraulic accumulator to let all pressure in it go out. J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) Disconnect the electrical connector (1). (2) Disconnect the hydraulic tube (4). (3) Release the clamp (3). (4) Remove the pressure transducer (2).
