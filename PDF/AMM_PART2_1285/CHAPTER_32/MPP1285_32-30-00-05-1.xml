(8) Pressurize hydraulic system 1 only ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200), until the hydraulic accumulator is charged, as follows: (a) Charge for 2.5 minutes (minimum). Then do the steps below. (9) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, make sure that the IND 1, IND 2, CMD, DOOR CMD, DOWN OVRD and AIR/GND A, B, C, and D CIRCUIT breakers are closed. (10) On the EICAS display, make sure that the LG/LEVER DISAGREE warning message and LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message are not shown. (11) On the EICAS, make sure that the three legs downlock indications show DN with green letters. (12) On the RMU Engine Backup page 2, make sure that the LG DN LOCKED message is shown. J. Operationally Check of the Extension and Retraction System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS AND EQUIPMENT IN THE LANDING GEAR AREA. WARNING: BEFORE YOU ENERGIZE OR DEENERGIZE THE AIRCRAFT WHEN IT IS ON JACKS AND THE LANDING GEARS ARE LOCKED UP, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO MAINTENANCE PERSONS AT WORK IN THE NOSE LANDING GEAR AREA BECAUSE THE NOSE GEAR DOORS ARE ELECTRICALLY CONTROLLED AND: • IF THE NOSE GEAR DOORS ARE CLOSED AND ELECTRIC POWER IS REMOVED, THE DOORS WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY; OR • IF THE NOSE GEAR DOORS ARE OPEN AND WITHOUT ELECTRIC POWER, THE DOORS WILL CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN ELECTRIC POWER IS APPLIED. IN EITHER CASE, SERIOUS INJURY TO MAINTENANCE PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (1) Do a check of the normal operation of the extension and retraction system. (a) Set the landing gear control lever to the UP position. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 32-30-00 Page 3 of 7 Rev 51 - Oct 31/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
