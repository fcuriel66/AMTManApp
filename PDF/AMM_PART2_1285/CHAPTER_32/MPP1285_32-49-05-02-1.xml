			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOSE WHEEL ASSEMBLY - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do the check of the static balancing and the standard/ alternate procedures for the balancing of the nose-landing-gear wheel assembly. The alternate balancing is given to permit the balancing of the nose wheel assembly without further tire removal to install the weight balancing. The operator can decide which procedure is more suitable. B. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 32-49-05-860-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. NOSE-LANDING-GEAR WHEEL ASSEMBLY - CHECK/BALANCING A. General (1) This procedures is done with the tire/wheel assembly out of the nose landing gear. (2) Do a check of the static balancing and, if necessary, do the balancing procedure when the nose landing gear wheel tire is replaced. (3) The wheel balance device must be held on a surface plate correctly leveled, and in an environment with no drafts. If the static balance stand is not leveled and if there are drafts, the balancing will be incorrect. B.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Do the check of the pressure and if necessary charge the nose-landing-gear wheel tire ( AMM TASK 32-49-04-600-801-A/300). J. Check of the Balancing of the Nose Landing Gear Wheel Assembly (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 861-002-A (1) Put the axle pin into the wheel hub. (2) Put the wheel assembly on the wheel balance device (GSE 109). (3) Turn the wheel assembly moderately. (4) After the wheel stops, mark the highest point on the tread of the tire with chalk (This is the lightest point on the wheel). Do the procedure many times to make sure that the lightest point position is correct. (5) Apply balance plaster to the lightest point found and turn the wheel assembly until making sure that it stops at random positions. (6) Remove the balance plaster and weigh it on a precision scale and take note. Balance plaster weight shows the degree of unbalance. (7) Refer to the table below for the balance plaster value: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 860-801-A/200 32-49-05 Page 3 of 7 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Refer to SUBTASK 32-49-05-862-001- 09 &lt; Balance plaster ≤ 27 A00 and do the balance Balance plaster &gt; 27 Discard the tire K. Standard/Alternate Balancing (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 862-002-A (1) Standard balancing: (a) Remove the tire from the wheel hub (AMM TASK 32-49-04-000-801-A/400). (b) Put the tire on the tire balance patch application device, with the lightest point found in the lowest position. (c) Set a balance weight with approximately 1 thru 2 grams less than the balance plaster weight to counterbalance the weight of the adhesive cement used. (d) With the levers of GSE 107, push the tire sides apart. (e) On the tire inside, make the area of the chalk mark rough. (f) Fully clean the tire inside, with cleaning solvent. (g) Prepare adhesive cement to attach the balance weight. (h) With a brush, apply the adhesive cement to the applicable tire inside surface very smoothly. Let it dry for 6 hours. (i) Apply other coat of adhesive cement to the tire inside surface and to the balance weight. Let it dry for one hour. (j) Apply balance weight to the tire inside surface. (k) Push the balance weight down with a roller to make bonding easier and remove all air bubbles from between the surfaces. (l) Remove the tire from the tire balance patch application device. (m) Install the tire on the wheel hub ( AMM TASK 32-49-05-400-801-A/400). (n) Do a check of the wheel balancing again to make sure it obeys the tolerance values. (2) Alternate balancing: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 860-801-A/200 32-49-05 Page 4 of 7 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Multiply the balance plaster weight value found in the step (6) of the paragraph J., by 2.5 and take note thereafter multiply the balance plaster weight value by 3 and take note. NOTE: • The value of the balancing weight that will be used on either end of the tie bolt (3) must be between the two values found in the step (a) above. • A balancing weight value nearer to the value found from the multiplication by 3 will probably result in a better balance. (b) Refer to BFGoodrich CMM 32-49-04 to set the balancing weight value between the two values found in the step (a) above. WARNING: FULLY DEFLATE THE TIRE BEFORE THE TIE BOLT NUTS ARE LOOSENED. CAUTION: INCORRECT PRELOAD AND FAILURE OF THE TIE BOLT WILL OCCUR IF THE COUNTERSUNK SIDE OF THE BALANCE WEIGHTS IS NOT AGAINST THE BOLT HEAD OR NUT. REFER TO FIGURE 202. (c) Deflate the tire. To do this, use GSE 023. (d) Remove the tie bolt nut and washer from the nose wheel where the balance weight will be installed (each one that is aliened with the lightest point in paragraph J.). (e) If a second balance weight is necessary in the same location, also remove the washer under the tie bolt head. (f) Apply antiseize compound (AMS 2518) to the load surfaces of the balance weights. (Figure 202). (g) Install the balance weight under the nut and, if necessary, also under the bolt head. NOTE: • When a balance weight is installed under the bolt head, the countersunk side must be pointed to the bolt head. (Figure 202). • A balance weight is used in the location of the washer. Only one balance weight can replace each washer. (h) Torque the nuts as referred to in BFGoodrich CMM 32-49-04. (i) Inflate the tire and do the check of the pressure ( AMM TASK 32-49-04-600-801- A/300). (j) Do a check of the wheel balancing again to make sure it obeys the tolerance values in according of table 201.
