Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Make sure that the landing gear safety pins are installed on all MLG and NLG ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (2) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Make sure that the hydraulic system is not energized. (4) Make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No. 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). J. Functional Check of the Landing-Gear Control-Lever After Replacement of the Landing Gear (Without Jacks) (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-003-A (1) Do this check: NOTE: To simulate an aircraft in-flight condition, it is necessary that you install a metallic target in front of the WOW (weight-on-wheels) proximity switches. The metallic target can be attached with adhesive tape. (a) Install a metallic target in front of all WOW proximity switches (two on each main landing gear and one on the nose landing gear) to simulate an aircraft in-flight condition. (b) Reset the air/ground channels of the LGEU - landing gear electronic unit as follows: 1. Open the AIR/GND A, AIR/GND B, AIR/GND C, and AIR/GND D circuit breakers. Then close the circuit breakers in 10 seconds maximum. NOTE: During the reset (3 sec. max.), the LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message is activated. After the reset, the message goes out of view. (c) Disconnect LG solenoid-valve connector P0037 and door solenoid valve connector P0036. (d) Make sure that the LDG GEAR IND 1, LDG GEAR IND 2, LG CMD, and DOOR CMD circuit breakers are closed. Result:  1 Make sure that the landing gear down indication on the EICAS and RMU is correct. (e) Set the control lever to the up position. Result:  1 Make sure that for the lever to move to the up position it is not necessary to push the down-lock override switch, installed on the control lever panel.
