Repair (Figure 801)  SUBTASK 370-002-A WARNING:ALWAYS OBEY THE MANUFACTURER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN YOU USE SEALANTS OR SOLVENTS. USE SEALANTS OR SOLVENTS ONLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS A GOOD AIRFLOW. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES OF THESE MATERIALS AND DO NOT GET THEM ON YOUR SKIN, IN YOUR EYES OR MOUTH. PUT ON APPROVED PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND GOGGLES. SEALANTS AND SOLVENTS ARE DANGEROUS AND IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THESE PRECAUTIONS, INJURY CAN OCCUR. (1) Clean the external surface of the wheel axle using solvent RHODIASOLVE E-23. (2) Repair the damage or scratches, in the chrome-plated surface of the wheel axle, as follows: CAUTION:BE CAREFUL TO REMOVE ONLY THE QUANTITY OF CHROME PLATING NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE DAMAGE. MAKE SURE THAT, AFTER THE REMOVAL, THE FINAL DEPTH IS NOT MORE THAN 0.178 MM (0.007 IN), IF IT IS, YOU MUST REPAIR THE TRAILING ARM AS GIVEN IN THE ELEB COMPONENT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CMM 32-10-01. (a) Smooth out the scratch or score with 450 or 600-grit sandpaper. Keep the repair area as small as possible. NOTE: Be careful not to remove more than 0.025 mm (0.001 in.) of the chrome- plating. (b) Do a visual inspection in the repaired area for oxidation or corrosion of the surface protection or marks, gripping signs, dents and wear because of use. As an aid, use a 10X to 30X minimum magnifying glass. WARNING: THE COMPONENT MUST BE REPLACED IMMEDIATELY IF ANY CRACK IS FOUND ON THE NONDESTRUCTIVE INSPECTION. (c) Do a nondestructive inspection in the repaired area by the fluorescent dye- penetrant method ASTM E 1417; use products such as MAGNAFLUX. The axle must be free from cracks and other defects. (d) Apply EPOXY primer above all the affected area. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 32-10-08 Page 4 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
