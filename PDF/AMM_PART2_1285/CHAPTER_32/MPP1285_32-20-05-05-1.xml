Refer to Figure 501, sheet 1. (10) On the RMU, select the ENGINE-PAGE 2 page and make sure that the LG DN LOCKED message comes into view. Refer to Figure 501, sheet 1. (11) (For aircraft PRE-MOD S.B.145-22-0004) Push the nose-landing-gear door indicator, on the glareshield panel, and make sure that the indicator lights come on ( lamp test). Refer to Figure 501, sheet 1. J. Operational Check of the Nose-Landing-Gear Door-Open Indication (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do a check of the nose-landing-gear door-open indication. NOTE: When necessary or to find a proximity switch failure, do the special proximity switch test ( AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-801-A/500). (a) Push the DN LOCK REL button and, at the same time, set the landing gear control lever to the UP position. Result: 1 Make sure that the color of the landing gear indicators, on the EICAS, changes to amber and after a few seconds, the same indicators, on the EICAS, change to red and the message LG LEVER DISAGREE comes into view on the EICAS. (b) Disconnect connectors P0039 and P0040 from the NOSE DOWN LOCK proximity sensors. Refer to Figure 501, sheet 2.
