If you use them, the test will not be satisfactory. • During the display test, the EICAS will show the caution messages as follows:  BRAKE DEGRADED (1), and  BRK OUTBD INOP or BRK INBD INOP. • (1) - This message is only applicable to aircraft equipped with:  -82402 Integrated Computer #1, -83402 Integrated Computer #2, -916 Data Acquisition Unit, or  -82406 Integrated Computer #1, -83406 Integrated Computer #2, -932 Data Acquisition Unit, or  -82426 Integrated Computer #1, -83426 Integrated Computer #2, -935 Data Acquisition Unit, or  -82407 Integrated Computer #1, -83407 Integrated Computer #2, -940 Data Acquisition Unit. • If these messages do not come into view, this means that the BCU or the DAU/EICAS are defective. (g) Click on the Status 1&amp;2, Status 3&amp;4, LRU Status and Misc Status buttons to find possible failures. NOTE: The screens for each button (Status 1&amp;2, Status 3&amp;4, LRU Status and Misc Status) will show the test results and, if there is a failure, the failure and the related component will be isolated. (h) Click on the SYSTEM DATA button. (i) Push the pilot's brake pedals and monitor the actual brake pressure sent to the brakes, as shown in the brake pressure field of the computer. Result: 1 Before you push the pedals, the brake pressure will show 0 to 120 psi in the left and right wheel positions. 2 At full stroke, the brake pressure will be 2700 to 3000 psi in the left and right wheel positions.   NOTE: 1. If the pressure of step 1 is more than 120 psi, replace the BCV. 2. If the pressure of step 2 is less than 2700 psi, do the brake- pedal transducer adjustment and test. Refer to AMM TASK 32-41-01-700-802-A/500. 3 For the tests of the outboard brakes, make sure that all pistons of wheels 1 and 4 touch the brakes. For the tests of the inboard brakes, make sure that all pistons of wheels 2 and 3 touch the brakes. (j) Do items (h) and (i) for the copilot's brake pedals.
