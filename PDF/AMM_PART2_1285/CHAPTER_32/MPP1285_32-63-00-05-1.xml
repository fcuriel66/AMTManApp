			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL  (Continued) QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Helps the other technician NLG, LH, and RH MLG I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: IF IT IS NECESSARY TO ENERGIZE THE AIRCRAFT WHILE IT IS IN THE IN- FLIGHT CONDITION, MAKE SURE THAT THE WEATHER RADAR BUTTON IS IN OFF POSITION ON THE WEATHER RADAR CONTROLLER IN THE COCKPIT. FAILURE TO DO THIS LETS THE RADAR BE OPERATIONAL AND INJURY TO PERSONS IN THE ADJACENT AREA CAN OCCUR. (1) Aircraft on the ground. (2) For aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No. 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (3) For aircraft POST-MOD SB145-32-0036, install the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (4) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (5) On the overhead panel, set the BATT 1 switch to OFF and make sure that the BATT 2 switch is set to OFF. NOTE: The switches of batteries 1 and 2 must be set to the OFF position to permit the external power to energize the electrical systems when the aircraft is in the AIR condition. (6) On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that the CLOCK 2 circuit breaker is closed. WARNING:MAKE SURE THAT THE PITOT SENSORS, STATIC PORTS, TAT SENSORS, AOA SENSORS AND ICE DETECTOR HEATERS ARE SET TO OFF AND ARE COLD. TAKE CARE NOT TO TOUCH THESE COMPONENTS WHEN THEY ARE HOT. IF YOU TOUCH THEM, THEY WILL CAUSE INJURY TO YOU. (7) Set the SENSORS (PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, and PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2) pushbuttons, on the overhead panel, to OFF. (8) On the LH/RH electrical-power control/distribution box (AMM SDS 24-60-00/1), open ICE DETECTOR 1 and 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT CLOSE tag on it. NOTE: When you disable the ice protection system in flight condition, caution messages referent the system are activated. J. Operational Check of Air/Ground System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A NOTE: If there is a suspicion of a proximity switch failure during the check, you can do the specific test of the proximity switch ( AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-801-A/500). (1) Do the check as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 32-63-00 Page 3 of 10 Rev 51 - Oct 31/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: These steps start the recording function of the FDR which will overwrite the data stored in the FDR. If it is necessary to keep the data stored on the FDR, open the FDR circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel or if it is necessary to keep the FDR on, do an FDR downloading as given in AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500. (a) Open the AIR/GND A, AIR/GND B, AIR/GND C, and AIR/GND D circuit breakers. Then, close the circuit breakers in 10 seconds maximum. NOTE: This is to reset the air/ground channels of the landing gear electronic unit (LGEU). During the reset processing (3 sec. max.), the LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message is activated. After the reset, the message goes out of view. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message goes out of view. (b) Push the TEST button of display controller 1. Result: 1 The self-test starts on PFD 1. NOTE: Result 1 means that LGEU channel A shows the aircraft-on-ground condition. (c) Do as follows: Result: 1 (Aircraft with AHRS 800): On the maintenance panel, set the AHRS switch to position 1. 2 (Aircraft with dual IRS or AHRS 900): 1. This step is not applicable because the air/ground system does not inhibit the test of the IRS test mode. 3 For step 1 above, the AHRS 1 self-test starts on PFD 1. NOTE: The result in step 3 above means that LGEU channel B1 shows the aircraft-on-ground condition. (d) Push the PGE button of RMU 1. Result: 1 The MAINTENANCE label is available. NOTE: Result 1 means that LGEU channel B2 shows the aircraft-on- ground condition. (e) Push the TEST button of display controller 2. Result: 1 The self-test starts on PFD 2. NOTE: Result 1 means that LGEU channel C shows the aircraft-on-ground condition. (f) (For aircraft with AHRS 800, do step below as follows). (For aircraft with AHRS 900 or dual IRS, go to action (g)). On the maintenance panel, set the AHRS switch to position 2 EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 32-63-00 Page 4 of 10 Rev 51 - Oct 31/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 The AHRS 2 self-test starts on PFD 2. NOTE: The result 1 means that LGEU channel D1 shows the aircraft-on- ground condition. (g) Look at the copilot's digital clock to see its indication. Result: 1 Make sure that on its ET / CHR display there is no colon between the hour and minute digits. 2 After one minute, make sure that the time on the ET / CHR display did not change. NOTE: The results 1 and 2 means that LGEU channel D1 shows the aircraft-on-ground condition. (h) Push the PGE button of RMU 2. Result: 1 The MAINTENANCE label is available. NOTE: Result 1 means that LGEU channel D2 shows the aircraft-on- ground condition. (i) Attach a metallic target with adhesive in front of the WOW 1 proximity switch of the LH MLG. Result: 1 Make sure that, after 10 seconds, the LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message does not come into view on the EICAS display. NOTE: If the LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message is shown on the EICAS, refer to the fault isolation manual to identify the defective WOW proximity switch. (j) Do steps (b) thru (i) again. (k) Attach a metallic target with adhesive in front of the WOW 2 proximity switch of the LH MLG. Result: 1 Make sure that, after 10 seconds, the LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message comes into view on the EICAS display. NOTE: This step is a check on the logic function of the AIR/GND system. It is necessary when the second WOW proximity switch is defective. (l) Do steps (b) thru (h) again. (m) Remove the metallic target from the WOW 1 and 2 proximity switches of the LH MLG. (n) Open the AIR/GND A, AIR/GND B, AIR/GND C, and AIR/GND D circuit breakers. Then, close the circuit breakers in 10 seconds maximum. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the LG AIR/GND FAIL caution message goes out of view. (o) Do steps (b) thru (h) again.
