			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Specific test of the proximity switch or the adjustment of the clearance between the proximity switch and its target is usually not necessary, but if the proximity switch and its mounting target show signs of damage, displacement from correct relative position, or they were replaced, do these procedures: • Specific test procedure in AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-801-A/500 or the alternative specific test procedure which uses the BREAK OUT BOX TEST in AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-802-A/500. • Adjustment procedure in AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-803-A/500 or the alternative adjustment procedure which uses only the FEELER GAGE in AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-804-A/500. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the AIR/GND A, AIR/GND B, AIR/GND C, and AIR/GND D circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tags from them. (3) On aircraft POST-MOD SB145-32-0036, remove the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200).
