			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Slowly open the filling/charging valve to release the pressure from the MLG shock absorber, until the shock absorber is fully compressed. (5) Remove the sealant from the bearing cap (10) with the aid of a nonmetallic tool. Refer to DET. B, Figure 801. (6) Remove the heat-shrinkable wax (14) and safety wire (13) from the bearing cap (10). Refer to Figure 802. (7) Move the bearing cap (10) from the installation torque condition (unseating torque) with the aid of GSE 492. Refer to Figure 801. CAUTION: • BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU HANDLE THE SHOCK ABSORBER TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE SWITCHES. • DO NOT LET HYDRAULIC FLUID FALL ON THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY. THIS CAN CAUSE CONTAMINATION OF THE SYSTEM. (8) Remove the shock absorber from the main landing gear leg, as applicable. Refer to AMM TASK 32-10-02-000-801-A/400. WARNING: DO THESE TASKS IN AN AREA WITH A GOOD AIRFLOW, WHERE THE SOLVENT VAPORS CANNOT BE COLLECTED AND THERE ARE NO PIECES OF EQUIPMENT WHICH CAN CAUSE FLAMES OR SPARKS. (9) Put the shock absorber in the vertical position with the filling/charging valve pointed down into a container. Refer to Figure 801. (10) Open the filling/charging valve, then compress and extend the shock absorber several times to remove the hydraulic fluid completely. NOTE: To drain the hydraulic fluid quickly, it is necessary to remove the filling/ charging valve. Be careful not to spurt out hydraulic fluid and soil the work area. (11) Put the compressed shock absorber on the table. J. Repair (Figure 801)  (Figure 802)  (Figure 803)  SUBTASK 370-002-A (1) Disassembly of the Shock Absorber. (a) Remove the filling/charging valve, if it is not removed yet. (b) Remove the bearing cap (10) from the shock absorber with the aid of GSE 492. Refer to Figure 801. (c) Remove the piston tube (1) from the cylinder (12). (d) Remove and discard the scraper ring (11) from the bearing cap (10). (e) Remove the slydring (8) and do a check of its outer side for wear. NOTE: If the slydring (8) shows wear, discard it. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 32-10-02 Page 4 of 10 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (f) For aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-32-0070, remove and discard the static ring (9) from the bearing cap (10). (g) Remove the bearing (5) from the piston tube (1). (h) Remove and discard the sealing rings (7) and (3), and the back-up ring (4) from the bearing (5). (i) Remove the slydring (6) and do a check of its inner side for wear. NOTE: If the slydring (6) shows wear, discard it. WARNING:ALWAYS OBEY THE MANUFACTURER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN YOU USE SEALANTS OR SOLVENTS. USE SEALANTS OR SOLVENTS ONLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS A GOOD AIRFLOW. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES OF THESE MATERIALS AND DO NOT GET THEM ON YOUR SKIN, IN YOUR EYES OR MOUTH. PUT ON APPROVED PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND GOGGLES. SEALANTS AND SOLVENTS ARE DANGEROUS AND IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THESE PRECAUTIONS, INJURY CAN OCCUR. (2) Assembly of the Shock Absorber. (a) Clean the metal parts. 1 Wash all metal parts with solvent. Use a brush and/or cloth soaked in solvent to clean the internal surfaces. 2 Blow them off with filtered compressed air. If necessary, use a cloth to dry them. 3 Repeat the cleaning process, if necessary. (b) Clean the nonmetallic parts. WARNING: • KEEP THE ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL AWAY FROM HEAT AND FLAMES. • USE EYE PROTECTION. 1 Use a brush to wash all nonmetallic parts with isopropyl alcohol. 2 Clean the nonmetallic parts with a soft cloth moist with isopropyl alcohol. 3 Wait until the isopropyl alcohol evaporates to make sure that the surface is clean. 4 Repeat the cleaning process, if necessary. WARNING: ALWAYS OBEY THE MANUFACTURER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN YOU USE HYDRAULIC FLUID. DO NOT GET HYDRAULIC FLUID ON YOUR SKIN, IN YOUR EYES OR MOUTH. PUT ON APPROVED PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND GOGGLES. HYDRAULIC FLUID IS TOXIC AND CAN CAUSE INJURIES. (c) Lubricate all O-rings with hydraulic fluid.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: MAKE SURE THE SEALING RING IS CORRECTLY INSTALLED. REFER TO FIGURE 803. (d) Install the slydring (6), new O-ring (3), new back-up rings (4), and sealing ring (7) into the bearing (5). Refer to Figure 802 and Figure 803. (e) For aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-32-0070, install the static ring (9) to the bearing cap (10). (f) Install the slydring (8) and scraper ring (11) into the bearing cap (10). (g) Lubricate the piston tube (1) with hydraulic fluid. (h) Put the bearing (5) on the piston tube (1) and slide it to the final installation position. WARNING: DO NOT GET COR-BAN IN YOUR MOUTH OR EYES, OR ON YOUR SKIN. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES FROM COR-BAN. PUT ON A PROTECTIVE SPLASH GOGGLES AND GLOVES WHEN YOU USE COR-BAN. COR-BAN IS A TOXIC MATERIAL. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THESE PRECAUTIONS, INJURY CAN OCCUR. (i) Apply COR-BAN 27L on the external surface of bearing (5). NOTE: Apply COR-BAN 27L to the upper and lower edges of the bearing. (j) Install the piston tube (1) with the bearing (5) into the cylinder (12). (k) Apply COR-BAN 27L on the bearing cap (10). NOTE: • To introduce the bearing (5) into the cylinder (12), it is necessary to push it down with the bearing cap (10). • Make sure that the bearing (5) touches the bottom of the cylinder (12). (l) Attach the bearing cap (10) to the cylinder (12) with GSE 492. NOTE: • Apply the final torque to the bearing cap (10) only after installation of the shock absorber to the aircraft. • Make sure that the shock absorber is compressed. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the shock absorber on the main landing gear leg. Refer to AMM TASK 32-10-02-400-801-A/400.
