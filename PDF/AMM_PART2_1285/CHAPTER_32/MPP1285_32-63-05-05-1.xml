General (1) This procedure makes it easier to find a failure in the landing-gear proximity switch. (2) The adjustment of the clearance (gap) between the proximity switch and its target is not usually necessary, but if the proximity switch and its target show signs of damage or displacement from correct relative position, do the adjustment procedure with the aid of the related GSE in AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-803-A/500 or the adjustment procedure with the aid of the Feeler Gage in AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-804-A/500. (3) If the electrical connector, with the inclusion of its electrical pins and adjacent areas, shows signs of damage, contamination or corrosion, do the maintenance procedures as follows: CAUTION:DO NOT USE OTHER PROCEDURE AND/OR CONTACT CLEANER TO CLEAN THE PROXIMITY SWITCHES TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO ELECTRICAL PINS AND SEALS. (a) To clean the wiring side of the electrical connector, refer to WM 20-50-00/201 standard practices. (b) To replace the wiring side of the electrical connector, use the repair kit; refer to IPC 32-50-00 or IPC 32-61-00 or IPC 32-63-00. Obey the instructions of the applicable wiring manual, chapter WM 20-50-00/201, Standard Practices. (c) To clean the proximity switch (including its electrical connector) and/or replace the proximity switch seals, refer to task AMM TASK 32-63-05-300-801-A/800. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) On aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No. 1 is totally released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (2) On aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, install the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valves (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (3) Make sure that the landing gear safety pins are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). WARNING: IF IT IS NECESSARY TO ENERGIZE THE AIRCRAFT WHILE IT IS IN THE IN-FLIGHT CONDITION, MAKE SURE THAT THE WEATHER RADAR BUTTON IS IN THE OFF POSITION ON WEATHER RADAR CONTROLLER IN THE COCKPIT. FAILURE TO DO THIS LETS THE RADAR BE OPERATIONAL AND INJURY TO PERSONS IN THE ADJACENT AREA CAN OCCUR. (4) It is recommended that you do this test with the aircraft de-energized, but if it is necessary, do this test with the aircraft energized ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/ 200). J. Functional Check of the Proximity Switches SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) If you will do this test with the aircraft energized, do as follows: (a) Open the circuit breaker related to the proximity switch (sensor) that you will test. Refer to Table 501 and to WM 32-60-50 and WM 32-61-50 and WM 32-33-50. NOTE: It is necessary to de-energize the proximity switch before disconnect its electrical connection. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU REMOVE THE HEAT-SHRINKABLE BOOT TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE ELECTRICAL CABLE AND ITS CONNECTOR. (2) For the connector that already has heat-shrinkable boot, remove it with a cutting tool. (3) Disconnect the applicable proximity switch connector. Refer to Table 501. WARNING:MAKE SURE THAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PLUG AND RECEPTACLE HAVE A GOOD MATING. IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLUG COMPLETELY COVERS THE RED STRIPE ON THE RECEPTACLE BODY. IF YOU NOT OBEY THIS PROCEDURE, DAMAGE AND/OR CORROSION TO THE PROXIMITY SWITCH CAN OCCUR. (4) Connect the electrical connector of the test box - GSE 541 to the proximity sensor electrical connector that will be tested. NOTE: If it is not possible to install the GSE 541, you must rotate the nose landing gear 45 degrees, to get access to the proximity sensor electrical connector. (5) For the test of the WOW or NLG DOOR-OPEN proximity switches, do as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 32-63-05 Page 4 of 45 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

For the applicable proximity switches, move the uplock box hook manually to simulate an uplock condition (target near proximity switch) and use the free-fall lever to put the uplock box hook back into the unlock condition (target away from proximity switch). Look at the BREAK OUT BOX to make sure that the related light comes on. Refer to Table 502. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-802-A/500 32-63-05 Page 12 of 45 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
