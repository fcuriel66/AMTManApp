Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) If a new door is to be installed and it does not have attachment holes for the door brush support, do as follows: (a) Cut the excess material as necessary for the correct adjustments to the door reinforcement. Refer to Figure 404, DET. C. NOTE: This reinforcement can cause an interference of the door brush support with the auxiliary door during their assemblage. (b) Use the door brush support as a template and transfer the related holes to the auxiliary door. (c) Drill the holes with a 7/32-inch dia. drill bit and make a 130ÃÂ° countersink. (d) Install the aerodynamic sealing brush. Refer to AMM TASK 53-04-11-400-801-A/ 400. J. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) (For aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-52-0047). Refer to (Figure 401) and Figure 403: (a) Before install the auxiliary door, do the previous adjustments to avoid damage to the door/fuselage, as follows: 1 Without retract the landing gear, manually put the new auxiliary door in position on the fuselage. 2 Verify if the auxiliary door contour fits onto wing stub bay. 3 If it not fits, trim the auxiliary door contour as necessary to guarantee the minimum gap to avoid interference and damage during landing gear retraction. 4 Fully lift the aircraft on jacks. Refer to AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-801-A/200. 5 Remove the external (OUTBD) wheel assembly ( AMM TASK 32-49-02-000-801-A/400). 6 Install the support on the new auxiliary door with four washers (16). 7 Connect the rods of the main door of the main landing gear (AMM TASK 32-10-06-400-801-A/400). 8 On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the ELEC PUMP 1 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. 9 Energize the aircraft.
