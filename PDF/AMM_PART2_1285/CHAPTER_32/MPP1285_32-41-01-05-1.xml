Functional Check of Brake Pedal Transducer (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 720-002-A NOTE: Start the test for the pilot brake pedals. (1) Install the applicable GSE. Refer to AMM MPP 32-41-00/500. (2) Connect to the GSE the pins related to the transducer in test. (3) Turn ON the electric hydraulic pump of the system in test. (4) To refer to the Test Page, select the fourth button on the Field Analyzer toolbar or push the keys (Ctrl+Sh+D) on the Field-Analyzer computer keyboard. (5) The information will be shown on the screen of the GSE. (a) With no pressure on brake pedal, read the brake pressure. Result: 1 The pressure shown must be less than or equal to 120 psi. If not, write down this value. (b) Fully apply the brake pedal and read the brake pressure: Result: 1 The pressure shown must be 2700 psi minimum. If not, write down this value. NOTE: • If the pressure of step 5 action (a) is 120 psi maximum and the pressure of step 5 action (b) is 2700 psi minimum, go to step (7). • If the pressure of step 5 action (a) is more than 120 psi and/or the pressure of step 5 action (b) is less than 2700 psi, do step (6).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • If, after, you do step 6, the pressure value is not in the correct range, it can be a sign that the brake control valve is defective. Replace the brake control value ( AMM TASK 32-41-06-000-801-A/400) and go to step 5 again. (6) Adjust the brake pedal deflection as follows (Refer to Figure 503). (a) Turn OFF the electric hydraulic pump of the system in test. (b) Remove the pilot seat (AMM TASK 25-11-01-000-801-A/400). (c) Remove the pedal assembly lining ( AMM TASK 25-12-06-000-801-A/400). (d) Disconnect the spring (3) or (4) from the stop bellcrank assembly (6) or (5), as applicable. Refer to Figure 503, sheet 1. (e) Remove the nut (7), washers (8) and (9), and the bolt (10) to release the lower rod-end of transducer (PPTRAN) (12) or (11), as applicable. Refer to Figure 503, sheet 1. (f) Remove the cotter pin (2), nut (1), and bolt (13) to release the lower rod end of the rod assembly (15) or (14), as applicable. Refer to Figure 503, sheet 1. NOTE: Discard the cotter pin (2) removed. (g) Remove the nut (27), washers (26) and (16), and the bolt (17). Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. (h) Remove the stop bellcrank assembly (6) or (5), as applicable. Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. (i) If necessary, adjust the minimum brake pedal deflection to a maximum 120 psi as follows: Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. 1 Remove the collar shear (24), the washer (23), delaminable washer (22), and the hi-lite pin (21). (SRM 51-40-02/1). Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. NOTE: Discard the collar shear (24) removed. 2 Reduce the delaminable washer (22) thickness to decrease the brake pressure. Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. NOTE: Each 0.25 mm (0.01 in) of the delaminated washer, is equal to a decrease of approximately 50 psi of brake pressure. 3 Install the hi-lite pin (21), delaminable washer (22), and washer (23) with a new collar shear (24). (SRM 51-40-02/1). Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. (j) If necessary, adjust the maximum brake pedal deflection to at least 2700 psi as follows: Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. 1 Remove the collar shear (25), the washer (18), delaminable washer (19), and the hi-lite pin (20). (SRM 51-40-02/1). Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. NOTE: Discard the collar shear (25) removed. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-802-A/500 32-41-01 Page 7 of 12 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 Reduce the delaminable washer (19) thickness to increase the brake pedal stroke. Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. NOTE: Each 0.5 mm (0.02 in) of the delaminated washer, is equal to an increase of approximately 100 psi of brake pressure. 3 Install the hi-lite pin (20), delaminable washer (19), and washer (18) with a new collar shear (25). (SRM 51-40-02/1). Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2. (k) Put the stop bellcrank assembly (6) or (5) in position. Refer to Figure 503, sheet 2.

(a) To refer to the Test Page, select the second button on the Field Analyzer toolbar or push the keys (Ctrl+Sh+I) on the Field-Analyzer computer keyboard. (b) Select the test: LVDT Loopback Test, Both Wheels. (c) Run and push the "Run Outboard test" button to run the outboard tests. NOTE: • After a few seconds, the message PASSED comes into view. If the message NOT RUN comes into view, do step (8) again and repeat the test. • To do the inboard tests, push the "Run Inboard test" button instead. 1 During the display test, the EICAS will show the caution messages as follows: a BRAKE DEGRADED b BRK OUTBD INOP or BRK INBD INOP 2 If these messages do not come into view, this means that the BCU or the DAU/EICAS are defective. (d) To refer to the Status Page, select the first button on the Field Analyzer toolbar or push the keys (Ctrl+Sh+S) on the Field Analyzer computer keyboard.
