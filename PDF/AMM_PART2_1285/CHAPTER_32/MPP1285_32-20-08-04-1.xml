This section gives the procedures to remove and install the nose-landing-gear sliding tube with the nose-landing-gear installed on the aircraft. B. You must do these procedures if you find hydraulic fluid leakage on the NLG Sliding Tube. NOTE: • It is not necessary remove the piston (3) if there is hydraulic fluid leakage. Refer to Figure 402 or Figure 403, as applicable. • If the jacks are at full travel or the distance between center of the NLG axle and the ground is more than 600 mm, it is not necessary disconnect the Main Brace Strut. If the distance is lower than 600 mm, it is necessary disconnect the Main Brace Strut. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task NLG 1 Helps the other technician NLG I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the ELEC PUMP 1, CMD, IND 1, and IND 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (2) For aircraft PRE-MOD SB 145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No. 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (3) For aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-32-0036, install safety pin of the NLG doors solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (4) Make sure that the safety pins of the landing gears are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (5) Lift the aircraft on jacks at their full travel (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-801-A/200). (6) Put GSE 003 under the sliding tube to support it. (7) Remove the nose wheel assemblies ( AMM TASK 32-49-05-000-801-A/400). (8) Depressurize the NLG shock absorber. To do this, do as follows: (a) Connect a hose to the filling valve (upper side of the shock absorber) and slowly open the valve to remove the hydraulic fluid from the shock absorber. (b) Manually retract the shock absorber to continue removing the hydraulic fluid. NOTE: It is to avoid an excessive spill of hydraulic fluid during the removal of the sliding tube from the NLG leg. (c) Slowly open the charging valve (lower side of the shock absorber) to release the Nitrogen pressure. J.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Make sure that the steering is at the zero position. The sliding tube must be extended. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU REMOVE THE SLIDING TUBE. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE SLIDING TUBE WILL NOT FALL DURING THE REMOVAL. (1) Disconnect the lower torque link (15), as follows: (a) Remove the cotter pins (1), nuts (2), washers (3) and bolts (18). Refer to Figure 401. CAUTION:AFTER DISCONNECTION OF THE LOWER TORQUE LINK, BE CAREFUL WITH THE TARGET LEVER ASSEMBLY TO NOT DAMAGE ITS PARTS. (b) Remove the pin (16), the lower torque link (15) and the washer (17) from the sliding tube assembly. Refer to Figure 401. NOTE: During the removal of the lower torque link (15), identify their related washer (17) for position to prevent their inverted installation. This could cause a steering misalignment. Refer to Figure 401. (2) Remove the charging valve (4) from the sliding tube assemble (6). Refer to Figure 401. (3) Remove the preformed packing (5) from the charging valve (4). Refer to Figure 401. (4) Remove the sealant (9) from the interfaces of the main fitting with the support (10) and lower cam (7). Refer to Figure 401. (5) Bend up tabs of the two lock washers (11) and (13) to unlock the set-screws (12) and (14). Refer to Figure 401. (6) Loose the set-screws (12) and (14), but not remove them yet. Refer to Figure 401. (7) Disconnect the lower-end of the main-brace-strut. Refer to AMM TASK 32-20-02-000-801-A/400, paragraph J. (2). (8) Operate the free-fall lever to release the hydraulic fluid from NLG actuator and to permit the free movement of NLG forward. (9) Hold the sliding tube axle and remove the jack GSE 003. (10) Manually move the NLG leg to forward position, until you can remove the sliding tube assemble (6). Refer to Figure 401. (11) Remove the set-screws (12) and (14) and remove and discard the lock washers (11) and (13). Refer to Figure 401. CAUTION: TAKE CARE DURING REMOVAL OF THE SLIDING TUBE ASSEMBLY TO NOT DAMAGE THEIR PARTS. (12) Remove the sliding tube assembly (6) from the NLG leg and collect the remaining oil. Refer to Figure 401. (13) Return the NLG leg to the vertical position. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 32-20-08 Page 4 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

(2) Connect the lower-end of the main-brace-strut. Refer to AMM TASK 32-20-02-400-801-A/400, paragraph J. (3) Position the lower torque link (15) between the lugs of the sliding tube (6). Refer to (Figure 401). NOTE: During the installation of the lower torque link (15), use the same washer (17) identified on the removal for position and side. This could avoid a steering misalignment. (4) Align the bolt hole of the pin (16) and install the pin and the washer (17) identified on the removal. Refer to (Figure 401). (5) Measure the axial play between the outboard side (right side lug) of one sliding tube (6) and the lower torque link (15). Refer to (Figure 401). NOTE: The maximum axial play is equal to or less than 0.05 mm (0.002 in). If the axial play is found out of the range after assembly, replace the washer (17) with a new machined washer to get axial play as specified. (6) Apply a thin layer of sealant COR-BAN 27 L to the bolt thread (18). Refer to (Figure 401). (7) Install the bolt (18), washer (3) and nut (2). Tighten nut with a torque of 3.0 to 4.0 N.m (26 to 35 lb.in), and install the cotter pin (1). Refer to (Figure 401). (8) Apply sealant PR1826B2ALO to the bolt head (18) and nut (2).

NOTE: The charge/fill valves must be open. (b) Connect a hose to the filling valve (upper side of the shock absorber) and with the sliding tube totally retracted, fill the nose landing gear shock absorber with oil MIL-PRF-5606 until the sliding tube is fully extended and the separator piston is at its end stop. NOTE: The hydraulic pressure must not be more than 1.5 MPa (225 psi). (c) Fully retract the sliding tube and collect the oil. (d) Do step (b) and (c) again two times to bleed all the air from the shock absorber. (e) Keep in retract position and close the filling valve (upper side of the shock absorber).
