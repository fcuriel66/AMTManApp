(a) Install the solid washer (9) (larger thickness) and spherical-bearing (7) on right top end of the main brace strut. NOTE: The spherical-bearing (7) has a blue rubber seal on one side. 1 The spherical-bearing (7) must be installed with its blue rubber seal facing the inboard nose landing gear. It means facing the solid washers (9). Refer to (Figure 403). (b) Install the solid washer (8) (smaller thickness) and spherical-bearing (7) on the left top end of the main brace strut, without the laminated washer (6). NOTE: The spherical-bearing (7) has a blue rubber seal on one side. 1 The spherical-bearing (7) must be installed with its blue rubber seal facing the inboard nose landing gear. It means facing the solid washers (8). Refer to (Figure 403). (c) If applicable, install the shim (13). Refer to (Figure 403). (d) Temporarily install the main-brace-strut in the bearing-housing. (e) Put the half-bearings in their installation position. (f) Install the bolts (2), washers (3) and (5), and nuts (4). (g) Apply a torque of 50.80 to 56.45 N.m (450 to 500 lb.in) to the nuts (4) of the half- bearings (1). (h) Manually move the main-brace-strut to the right.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (i) Measure the clearance between the solid washer (8) and the surface D of the main-brace-strut with a feeler gage to the left side. Refer to Figure 403, DET. C. (j) Remove the main-brace-strut. (k) Prepare the laminated washer (6) with the thickness found in step (i). NOTE: The maximum clearance is 0.05 mm (0.002 in). J. Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Use a dry lint-free cloth to remove unwanted remaining grease from the components as necessary. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE SOLVENT GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (2) With a cloth soaked in Rhodiasolve E-23, clean the remaining grease from the components as necessary. (3) Install a solid washer (9) (larger thickness) and a spherical-bearing (7) on the right top end of the main brace strut. Refer to (Figure 403). NOTE: The spherical-bearing (7) has a blue rubber seal on one side. (a) The spherical-bearing (7) must be installed with its blue rubber seal facing the inboard nose landing gear. It means facing the solid washers (9). Refer to (Figure 403). (4) Install laminated washer (6) prepared as given in paragraph I.(2), solid washer (8) (smaller thickness), and spherical bearing (7), at the left top end of the main brace strut. Refer to (Figure 403). NOTE: The spherical-bearing (7) has a blue rubber seal on one side. (a) The spherical-bearing (7) must be installed with its blue rubber seal facing the inboard nose landing gear. It means facing the solid washers (8). Refer to (Figure 403). (5) If applicable, install the shim (13). Refer to (Figure 403). CAUTION:AEROSHELL GREASE 22 MUST NOT BE MIXED WITH AEROSHELL GREASE 33. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENTS CAN OCCUR. (6) Fill the lubrication channel of the main-brace-strut bearing with Aeroshell Grease 22. Refer to (Figure 403) NOTE: You can use alternative Aeroshell 33 grease. (7) Apply the same grease used in step (6) to the inner surface of bearing housing (contact surface with the spherical bearing). Refer to Figure 403.
