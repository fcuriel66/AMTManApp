			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Make sure that the landing gear safety pins are installed on the LH and RH MLG ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (3) Pressurize the hydraulic system 1 and 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (4) If the aircraft is on the jacks, remove the electrical connectors of the air/ground proximity switches related to the MLG and NLG "or" open de air/ground circuit breakers B and D. It is to keep the aircraft in "ground" condition. J. Operationally Check Brake Shuttle Valve (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do the check of the brake shuttle valve below: (a) Operate the pilot or co-pilot brake pedals. Result: 1 The MLG wheels are locked. NOTE: If the aircraft is in ground condition, make sure that the brake actuating pistons of all brake assemblies are in operation. (b) Release the brake pedals. Result: 1 The MLG wheels are unlocked. NOTE: If the aircraft is in ground condition, make sure that the brake actuating pistons of all brake assemblies are not in operation. (c) Operate the emergency/parking brake handle. Result: 1 The MLG wheels are locked. NOTE: • If the aircraft is in ground condition, make sure that the brake actuating pistons of all brake assemblies are in operation. • To prevent hydraulic fluid transference from system 1 to system 2 or vice versa, first apply brakes with the pedals and then pull or release the emergency/parking brake handle. (d) Release the emergency/parking brake handle. Result: 1 The MLG wheels are unlocked. NOTE: • If the aircraft is in ground condition, make sure that the brake actuating pistons of all brake assemblies are not in operation. • To prevent hydraulic fluid transference from system 1 to system 2 or vice versa, first apply brakes with the pedals and then pull or release the emergency/parking brake handle. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Depressurize the hydraulic system 1 and 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200).
