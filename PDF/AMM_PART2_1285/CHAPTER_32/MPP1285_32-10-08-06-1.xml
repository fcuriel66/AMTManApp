Preparation SUBTASK 840-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A SAFE CONDITION BEFORE YOU DO THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. THIS IS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (1) Use personal protection equipment while you do the tasks. (2) All related persons must know the correct solvent handling procedures. (3) Do these tasks in an area with a good flow of air, where solvent vapors cannot collect and with no pieces of equipment which can cause flames or sparks. (4) A fire extinguisher with a minimum of 25 kg of carbon dioxide or equivalent must be available. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 1, CMD, IND 1, and IND 2 circuit breakers and attach DO-NOT-CLOSE tags to them. (6) For aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in the hydraulic system 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (7) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, install the safety pin on the NLG doors solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (8) Make sure that the safety pins of the landing gears are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (9) Remove the main wheels from the axle. Refer to AMM TASK 32-49-02-000-801-A/400. (10) Remove the brake assembly from the wheel axle. Refer to AMM TASK 32-49-03-000-801-A/400. J. Inspection of MLG Wheel Axle for General Condition (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 212-004-A WARNING:ALWAYS OBEY THE MANUFACTURER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN YOU USE SEALANTS OR SOLVENTS. USE SEALANTS OR SOLVENTS ONLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS A GOOD AIRFLOW. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES OF THESE MATERIALS AND DO NOT GET THEM ON YOUR SKIN, IN YOUR EYES OR MOUTH. PUT ON APPROVED PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND GOGGLES. SEALANTS AND SOLVENTS ARE DANGEROUS AND IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THESE PRECAUTIONS, INJURY CAN OCCUR. (1) Clean the external surface of the wheel axle with solvent RHODIASOLVE E-23. (2) Visually examine the external surface areas (non-chrome-plated areas) of the axle, for corrosion, scratches, or other types of damage. As an aid, use a 5X magnifying glass . If you see corrosion, scratches, or other damage, replace the trailing arm. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-10-08-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-10-08-400-801-A/400 for installation. (3) With the aid of a borescope, examine the internal bore of the axle for corrosion signs. If you find corrosion, replace the trailing arm. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-10-08-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-10-08-400-801-A/400 for installation. (4) Visually examine the outer (A) and inner (B) bearing seats in the chrome-plated area of the axle for signs of overheating. If you see signs of overheating, replace the trailing arm. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-10-08-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-10-08-400-801-A/400 for installation. (5) Visually examine the outer (A) and inner (B) bearing seats in the chrome-plated area of the axle for scratches or other types of damage. Do the check on all faces (top, forward, bottom, and aft) of the axle. If you find scratches or other types of damage, do as follows: (a) Measure the depth of the damage in the chrome-plated area of the axle . (b) Repair the surface protection if the depth measured is less than or equal to 0.152 mm (0.006 in). Refer to AMM TASK 32-10-08-300-801-A/800.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: In the case of a 0.152 mm (0.006 in) deep damage, the repair may reach 0.178 mm (0.007 in) in depth, which is the serviceability limit for a repaired arm. (c) If the depth measured is more than 0.152 mm (0.006 in), replace the trailing arm (AMM MPP 32-10-08/400). NOTE: To repair the old trailing arm, refer to the ELEB Component Maintenance Manual CMM 32-10-01. (6) If problem is found in step (4) or (5), replace the bearings or the wheel related to the damage. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 840-003-A (1) Install the brake assembly on the wheel axle. Refer to AMM TASK 32-49-03-400-801- A/400. (2) Install the main wheels on the axle. Refer to AMM TASK 32-49-02-400-801-A/400. (3) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036, remove the safety pin from the NLG doors solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (4) Remove the safety pins from the landing gears ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/ 200). (5) On the circuit breaker panel, close the ELEC PUMP, CMD, IND 1, and IND 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tags from them.
