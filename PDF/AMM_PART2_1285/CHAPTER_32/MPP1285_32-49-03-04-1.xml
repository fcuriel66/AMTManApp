			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 1 and ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (2) Make sure that the pressure in hydraulic systems No. 1 and No. 2, in the Landing Gear/Main Door hydraulic accumulator, and in the Emergency/Parking Brake hydraulic accumulator is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (3) Control the ailerons up and down, or the rudder left and right, until the EICAS shows zero-PSI pressure in the hydraulic system. (4) Lift the related wheel of the aircraft with a jack (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-803-A/200). (5) Remove the wheel assembly ( AMM TASK 32-49-02-000-801-A/400). (a) If necessary, do a general vision inspection on the MLG wheel axle. Refer to ( AMM TASK 32-10-08-200-801-A/600 NOTE: This is an Embraer Optional Task. Refer to SMRD. (6) Make sure that the handle of the emergency/parking brake is not operated.

Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A CAUTION: • DO NOT TWIST THE HYDRAULIC HOSE WHEN YOU TORQUE THE CONNECTORS. THIS CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE HOSE AND MAKE IT UNSERVICEABLE. • USE TWO WRENCHES WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL THE HYDRAULIC HOSE. USE ONE WRENCH TO HOLD THE CONNECTOR AND OTHER WRENCH TO LOOSEN OR TIGHTEN THE HYDRAULIC- HOSE COUPLING NUT. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THE HYDRAULIC HOSE CAN OCCUR. • DO NOT LET  HYDRAULIC OIL SPILL ON THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY. (1) Disconnect the hydraulic hoses (3) and (4) or (6) and (7), as applicable to the aircraft configuration. For this, loosen the quick-disconnect couplings or the normal (threaded) couplings, as applicable. Tag the hydraulic hoses to prevent inversion during their installation. NOTE: On aircraft with quick-disconnect coupling hoses installed, keep the adapter of the shuttle valve installed to the valve. (2) Remove the locking pin (1).

CAUTION: • DO NOT TWIST THE HYDRAULIC HOSE WHEN YOU TORQUE THE CONNECTORS. THIS CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE HOSE AND MAKE IT UNSERVICEABLE. • USE TWO WRENCHES WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL THE HYDRAULIC HOSE. USE ONE WRENCH TO HOLD THE CONNECTOR AND OTHER WRENCH TO LOOSEN OR TIGHTEN THE HYDRAULIC- HOSE COUPLING NUT. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THE HYDRAULIC HOSE CAN OCCUR. • DO NOT LET  HYDRAULIC OIL SPILL ON THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY.

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task RH and LH Main Landing Gears I. Preparation (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 841-005-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is in the same configuration as it was at the end of the removal task. J. Installation (Figure 405) (Figure 406)  SUBTASK 420-003-A (1) Install the brake assembly shuttle valve (1), as follows (Refer to (Figure 406): (a) Apply a thin layer of hydraulic fluid to the new preformed packing (10) and the packing retainer (9). (b) Install a packing retainer (9) and a new preformed packing (10) in the shuttle valve (1). (c) Install the washers (4) and (7) on the bolts (6) and (8). (d) Clean the shuttle valve (1) and its installation position at the piston housing with isopropyl alcohol. (e) Attach the shuttle valve (1) on the piston housing assembly (11). NOTE: Make sure that the shuttle valve inlet ports is in a up position toward the hydraulic bleeder valve (ref). (f) Install the bolts (6) and (8) with washers (4) and (7) through the shuttle valve (1) in the piston housing assembly (11). (g) Apply a torque of 7.9 to 9.0 N.m (70 to 80 lb.in) to the bolts (6) and (8). (h) Safety the bolts (6) and (8) with lockwire (5), if applicable to the aircraft configuration. (i) Apply a thin layer of hydraulic fluid to the new O-rings (3). (j) Install the new O-rings (3) on the quick-disconnect couplings (2). (k) Install the quick-disconnect couplings (2) in the shuttle valve (1) inlet port. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 32-49-03 Page 19 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (l) Apply a torque of 7.9 to 9.0 N.m (70 to 80 lb.in) to the quick-disconnect couplings (2). (m) Safety the quick-disconnect couplings (2) in the shuttle valve (1) with lockwire (12). K. Installation SUBTASK 420-004-A CAUTION: • USE TWO WRENCHES WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL THE HYDRAULIC HOSE. USE ONE WRENCH TO HOLD THE CONNECTOR AND OTHER WRENCH TO LOOSEN OR TIGHTEN THE HYDRAULIC- HOSE COUPLING NUT. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THE HYDRAULIC HOSE CAN OCCUR. • DO NOT LET  HYDRAULIC OIL SPILL ON THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY. (1) Connect the hydraulic hoses (1) and (2) or (4) and (5), as applicable to the aircraft configuration. Obey the correct positions of the hydraulic hoses and remove the tags. Refer to (Figure 405). CAUTION: • DO NOT TWIST THE HYDRAULIC HOSE WHEN YOU TORQUE THE CONNECTORS. THIS CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE HOSE AND MAKE IT UNSERVICEABLE. • USE TWO WRENCHES WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL THE HYDRAULIC HOSE. USE ONE WRENCH TO HOLD THE CONNECTOR AND OTHER WRENCH TO LOOSEN OR TIGHTEN THE HYDRAULIC- HOSE COUPLING NUT. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THE HYDRAULIC HOSE CAN OCCUR. • DO NOT LET  HYDRAULIC OIL SPILL ON THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY. (2) Connect the hydraulic hoses (1) and (2) or (4) and (5), as applicable to the aircraft configuration, as follows (Figure 406): NOTE: Obey the correct positions of the hydraulic hoses and remove the tags. (a) For aircraft with MLG that have hydraulic hoses with quick-disconnect couplings, do as follows: 1 Put the hydraulic hoses (1) and (2) to the shuttle valve. Refer to (Figure 406), DET B, as applicable to the aircraft configuration. 2 Hold on the quick disconnect and manually apply torque. (b) For aircraft with MLG that have hydraulic hoses with normal (threaded) couplings, do as follows: 1 Connect the hydraulic hoses (4) and (5) to the shuttle valve. 2 Use a torque wrench to torque the hydraulic hoses (4) and (5) to 9.6 - 11.9 N.m (85 - 105 lb.in). Refer to (Figure 405), DET B, as applicable to the aircraft configuration. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 32-49-03 Page 20 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL L. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) On the circuit breakers panel, close the ELEC PUMP 1 and ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (2) Bleed the air from the brake hydraulic line ( AMM TASK 32-40-00-800-801-A/200). NOTE: It is only to bleed the hydraulic lines (emergency and normal) of the brake assembly that had the shuttle valve replaced. (3) On the hydraulic panel, on the overhead panel, set the ELEC PUMP switch of system 2 to ON and apply parking brake. Keep the ELEC PUMP ‘ON’ for at least 30 seconds. (4) Set the ELEC PUMP switch of system 2 to OFF. (5) After five minutes (minimum), release the parking brake. (6) Do an inspection for hydraulic fluid leakage. No leakage that can be measured is permitted (less than one drop). If any leakage is detected, disassembly the shuttle valve (1), inspect the o’rings (9) and (10) and replace them, if they are damaged. Refer to (Figure 406). NOTE: To prevent hydraulic fluid transference from system 1 to system 2 or vice versa, first apply brakes with the pedals and then pull or release the emergency/parking brake handle. (7) Do the operational check of the brake shuttle valve (AMM TASK 32-49-07-700-801-A/ 500). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 32-49-03 Page 21 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
