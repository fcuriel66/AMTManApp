Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: WARNING: DO NOT GET CORROSION INHIBITING COMPOUND IN YOUR MOUTH OR EYES, OR ON YOUR SKIN. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES FROM CORROSION INHIBITING COMPOUND. PUT ON A PROTECTIVE SPLASH GOGGLE AND GLOVES WHEN YOU USE CORROSION INHIBIT COMPOUND. CORROSION INHIBIT COMPOUND IS A TOXIC MATERIAL. CAUTION:DO NOT LET THE UPPER-TORQUE-LINK AND LOWER-TORQUE-LINK ASSEMBLIES HIT THE SLIDING TUBE. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THESE PARTS CAN OCCUR. (1) To install the NLG lower-torque-link (26) on the sliding tube (11), do as follows: (a) Put the lower torque link (26) between the lugs of the sliding tube (11) and install the pin (27). (b) Measure the distance between the outboard side (right side lug) of one sliding tube (11) and the lower torque link (26). Record this distance as axial play. (c) Machine the washer (28) or select other one listed at IPC 32-20-00, to get an axial play of 0.05 mm (0.002 in.). (d) Remove the pin (27), position the washer (28), install the lower torque link (26) between the lugs of the sliding tube (11) and install the pin again (27). NOTE: During the installation of the lower torque link (26), use the same washer (28) identified on the removal or the new washer for position and side. This could avoid a steering misalignment. (e) Apply a thin layer of corrosion inhibiting compound COR-BAN 27L to the thread of the bolt (12).
