			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL LANDING GEAR PROXIMITY AND PRESSURE SWITCH PROTECTION / RESTORATION - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the general procedures to do the protection and restoration of the landing gear proximity switches and the harness electrical connectors against corrosion and damage. B. These protection/restoration procedures include: • Grease application to the harnesses located inside the adaptors of the proximity and pressure switch plug connectors, and to the electrical connectors. • The application of a coat of lubricant and anticorrosive film on the contacts of the electrical connectors (proximity switches and harness) before the connection of the landing gear proximity and pressure switches. • Sealing the aluminum bushing and spraying corrosion preventive compound on the electrical connector assembly of the proximity switches. • The protection of the pressure switches connector by installing a heat-shrinkable boot on the connector. • The check for contamination and/or corrosion in the electrical pins of the proximity switch and harness and the instructions to do the restoration of the components. • The check for damage on the harness electrical connectors and instructions to do the restoration of the components. C. These procedures are applicable to the uplock/dowlock landing gear indication, steering system, nose landing gear door, and air/ground (WOW) system proximity switches and the connector of the pressure switches. D. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Connect the backshell (3) to the electrical plug connector (2) again. Refer to DET. B, Figure 201. NOTE: Apply this step only to the backshell repaired with Cantwell Cullen Repair Kit. (6) Apply a torque of 6.2-6.8 N.m (55-60 lb.in) to backshell (3) or (8). NOTE: Apply this step only to the backshell repaired with Cantwell Cullen Repair Kit or Aerazur Repair Kit. (7) Disconnect the related electrical connector (4) from the proximity switch (7) and do a check for contamination and/or corrosion on the electrical pins, electrical connector harness and adjacent areas. Refer to DET. C, Figure 201. (a) If the electrical connector (4) or proximity switch (7) (with its electrical pins) or its electrical harness shows signs of damage, contamination or corrosion, do the maintenance procedures as follows: 1 The connector must be replaced immediately if the cumulative area of corrosion is greater than 10% of the total connector area. If the cumulative area of corrosion is less than 10% of the total connector surface area, the connector can be cleaned or repaired only. CAUTION: DO NOT USE OTHER PROCEDURE AND/OR CONTACT CLEANER TO CLEAN THE PROXIMITY SWITCHES TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO ELECTRICAL PINS AND SEALS. 2 To clean the wiring side of the electrical connector (4), refer to WM 20-50-00/201 standard practices. 3 To replace the wiring side of the electrical connector (4), use the repair kit, refer to IPC 32-50-00 or IPC 32-61-00 or IPC 32-63-00. Obey the instructions of the applicable wiring manual, chapter WM 20-50-00/201, Standard Practices. 4 To do the maintenance on the electrical connectors, obey the instructions of the SWPM 20-50-00 maintenance practices manual. 5 To do the repair procedures on the electrical wiring and harness, obey the instructions of the SWPM 20-21-00 maintenance practices manual. 6 To clean the proximity switch (7) (with its electrical connector) and/or replace the proximity switch seals, refer to AMM TASK 32-63-05-300-801-A/ 800. (8) Clean the proximity switch (7) and remove contamination with a nonmetal brush and alcohol. (9) Dry with low pressure (less than 25 psi) compressed air or a clean, lint-free cloth. Make sure that the connector surfaces are completely dry. (a) If, after the component is properly cleaned and dry, there is visual evidence of corrosion damage, it can be necessary to replace the proximity switch.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: The corrosion preventive compound is not designed to remove corrosion. It will clean and revitalize a suspected connector but cannot replace damaged areas. WARNING: DO NOT LET LUBRICANT AND ANTICORROSIVE FILM PN LEKTRO-TECH SUPER CORR-A GET IN YOUR MOUTH OR EYES, OR ON YOUR SKIN. PUT ON A PROTECTIVE SPLASH GOGGLE AND GLOVES. KEEP THE COMPOUND AWAY FROM SPARKS, FLAME, AND HEAT. THE PRODUCT IS A POISONOUS AND FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE. CAUTION:DO NOT APPLY THE CORROSION PREVENTIVE COMPOUND MIL- PRF-81309 TO THE INTERNAL SIDE OF THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR AND PROXIMITY SWITCH CONNECTOR (PINS). IF YOU NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION DAMAGE TO DE PARTS CAN OCCUR. (10) Before the connection of the connector (4) with proximity switch (7), Apply the Lektro- Tech Super Corr-A (6) to the internal side of the electrical connector and proximity switch pins surfaces. Refer to DET. C and D, Figure 201. (a) For aerosol applications, apply two coats, if necessary. (Wait 30 seconds after you apply the first coat to apply the second) (b) Apply the compound for a uniform coverage of the connector and pins from a distance of 25 - 30 cm (10 - 12 in). NOTE: There is not a definition for the exact amount of spray to be applied, but the product should cover the contacts without excess spray. Excess spray does not cause any damage to the connector contacts and/or rubber, but can cause dirt accumulation. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE METHYL-ETHYL-KETONE (MEK). PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES, PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE GAS. DO THE WORK IN AN AREA WHICH HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. THE METHYL-ETHYL- KETONE (MEK) IS POISONOUS AND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. (c) Excess sprays can be removed with acetone or MEK. WARNING:MAKE SURE THAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PLUG AND RECEPTACLE HAVE A GOOD MATING. IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLUG COMPLETELY COVERS THE RED STRIPE ON THE RECEPTACLE BODY. IF YOU NOT OBEY THIS PROCEDURE, DAMAGE AND/OR CORROSION TO THE PROXIMITY SWITCH CAN OCCUR. (11) Reconnect the electrical connector (4) to proximity switch (7). Refer to DET. C, Figure 201 and refer to SWPM 20-50-00. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYSULFIDE SEALANT. PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING; DO THE WORK IN AN AREA WHICH HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. (12) Apply polysulfide sealant (5) to indicated area of the bushing (REF.). Refer to DET. C, Figure 201. NOTE: Wait until the sealant is dry to touch, before you do the step 13. Refer to Spec. AMS3281.
