			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: IF IT IS NECESSARY TO ENERGIZE THE AIRCRAFT WHILE IT IS IN THE IN- FLIGHT CONDITION, MAKE SURE THAT THE WEATHER RADAR BUTTON IS IN OFF POSITION ON WEATHER RADAR CONTROLLER ON THE COCKPIT. FAILURE TO DO THIS LETS THE RADAR BE OPERATIONAL AND INJURY TO PERSONS IN THE ADJACENT AREA CAN OCCUR. WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE PITOT 1 - TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 3, AND PITOT 2 - TAT 2/AOA 2 SENSOR PUSHBUTTONS, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET AT OFF. (1) Aircraft on the ground. (2) For aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No. 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (3) For aircraft POST-MOD SB145-32-0036, install the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (4) Install the landing gear safety pins ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (5) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (6) On the overhead panel, set the BATT 1 switch to OFF and make sure that the BATT 2 switch is set to OFF. NOTE: The switches of batteries 1 and 2 must be set to the OFF position to permit the external power to energize the electrical systems when the aircraft is in the AIR condition. (7) Do the pre-check as follows: (a) On the circuit breaker panel, open the LDG GEAR IND1 circuit breaker. 1 See, on EICAS display, if the status of the landing gear indications (three boxes) are "DN" and green. 2 If some box is out of this configuration, do a check of the related DNLOCK proximity switch ( AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-801-A/500) and related harness. (b) Close the LDG GEAR IND1 circuit breaker. (c) On the circuit breaker panel, open the LDG GEAR IND2 circuit breaker. 1 See, on EICAS display, if the status of the landing gear indications (three boxes) are "DN" and green. 2 If some box is out of this configuration, do a check of the related DNLOCK proximity switch ( AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-801-A/500) and related harness. (d) Close the LDG GEAR IND2 circuit breaker. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 32-62-00 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (8) Show a condition equivalent to that of the AIR/GND system in flight. Follow the steps (9) through (14) below. NOTE: These steps start the recording function of the FDR which will overwrite the data stored in the FDR. If it is necessary to keep the data stored in the FDR, open the FDR circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel or if it is necessary to keep the FDR on, do an FDR downloading according to AMM TASK 31-31-00-700-803-A/500. (9) Attach a metallic target with adhesive in front of the WOW (WOW 1 and WOW 2) proximity switches installed in the left and right main landing gears. (10) On the circuit breaker panel, open the AIR/GND A, AIR/GND B, AIR/GND C, and AIR/GND D circuit breakers, then close them in 10 seconds maximum. (11) Push the PGE button of RMU 1 and RMU 2 and make sure that the MAINTENANCE label is not available on both RMU displays (aircraft in flight condition). (12) Set the thrust control levers of engines 1 and 2 to the THRUST SET position. (13) Set the flaps to the zero-degree (0ÃÂ°) position. (14) The RA 1 and RA 2 (optional) circuit breakers open to show a condition equivalent to radio altimeter(s) not valid. (15) The LDG GEAR IND 1 and LDG GEAR IND 2 circuit breakers open to show a condition equivalent to landing gear not locked down. NOTE: Immediately after you do the step (15), the three position indications of the landing gear should be cross-hatched in amber. After 20 seconds, the "LG LEVER DISAGREE" message comes on view on the EICAS display and the three position indications become red. (16) Make sure that the N2 SIGNAL (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) circuit breakers are closed (engines shut down). J. Operationally Check Landing-Gear Warning System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A NOTE: If there is a suspicion of proximity switch failure during the check, you can do the specific test of the proximity switch ( AMM TASK 32-63-05-700-801-A/500). (1) Do the check as follows: (a) Set the thrust control lever of engine 1 to the IDLE position. Result: 1 The voice message "LANDING GEAR" starts. (b) Set the thrust control lever of engine 1 to the THRUST SET position. Result: 1 The voice message "LANDING GEAR" stops. (c) Set the thrust control lever of engine 2 to the IDLE position. Result: 1 The voice message "LANDING GEAR" starts. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 32-62-00 Page 4 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
