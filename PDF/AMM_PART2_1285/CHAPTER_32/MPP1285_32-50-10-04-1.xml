			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task On the nose landing gear I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A SAFE CONDITION BEFORE YOU DO THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. THIS IS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (1) Use personal protection equipment while you do the tasks. (2) All related persons must know the safe solvent handling procedures. (3) Do these tasks in an area with a good flow of air, where solvent vapors cannot collect, and with no pieces of equipment which can cause flames or sparks. (4) A fire extinguisher with a minimum of 25 kg of carbon dioxide or equivalent must be available. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 1, CMD, IND 1, and IND 2 circuit breakers and attach DO-NOT-CLOSE tags to them. (6) For aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system No. 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (7) For aircraft POST-MOD SB145-32-0036, install the safety pin of the NLG doors solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (8) Make sure that the safety pins of the landing gears are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (9) Lift the aircraft on jacks until you get the mechanical neutral position of the nose wheel steering system. Refer to AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-801-A/200. NOTE: When the NLG is fully extended, two cams engage with each other to mechanically center the wheels at 0ÃÂ°. J. Removal (Figure 401)  (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: ALWAYS USE EYE PROTECTION, RESPIRATOR, AND RUBBER GLOVES FOR PROTECTION FROM EPOXY, ADHESIVES, AND BONDING AGENTS. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE PLATE ATTACHMENT SURFACE WHEN THE PLATE IS REMOVED. (1) For aircraft with scale not riveted, do as follows. Refer to Figure 401. (a) Remove the sealant from around the steering-indication marking plate (1) or steering indication scale (3) with the aid of a spatula. NOTE: If it is necessary to replace the two plates to make sure of the correct indication of the NLG wheels at 0ÃÂ°, first remove one of the plates and EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 32-50-10 Page 3 of 11 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Make sure that the holes of the plate are aligned. If necessary, use a scriber and mark the plate alignment position with the receiving area of the support. 6 Carefully turn the indication scale (2) on the rivet (3) to get the best access to the rear surface. 7 Apply a layer of Loctite Activator 7407 to the indication scale (2) back surface. 8 Apply a layer of adhesive Loctite 3298 to the faying surface of the support (4). 9 Turn the indication scale (2) to the correct position. 10 Use your fingers and press the indication scale (2) from the middle to the end of the faying surface of the support (4). NOTE: Make sure that the plate outer holes align with the holes of the support. If necessary, use an alignment tool and align the plate with the faying surface of the nose landing gear. 11 Install the new rivets (3) in the outer holes. 12 Use a hammer to fully install the three rivets (3). 13 Use a lint-free wiper cloth and remove unwanted adhesive. NOTE: Make sure that there is no clearance between the plate and the nose landing gear. 14 Apply a thin bead of Sealing Compound PR1826B2ALO around the edges of the indication scale (2). NOTE: • Make sure that the plate outer holes align with the holes of the support. If necessary, use an alignment tool and align the plate with the faying surface of the nose landing gear. • Sealant P/S 870B-2 or sealant AC-665 B-2 can be used as an alternative to sealant PR1826B2ALO. After twenty-four hours after the application of these alternative sealants, apply a layer of varnish 683-3-2/X-310A to them. (b) Install the new indication mark plate (1) as follows. Refer to (Figure 402). 1 1 Rub the backside of the indication mark plate (1) and the receiving area of the cuff assembly (5) with a lint- free wiper cloth moist with solvent RHODIASOLVE E-23, to remove dirt such as dust, grease, oil, or other contaminants. 2 Apply a layer of Loctite 3298 with Activator 7407 to the back of the steering- indication marking plate (1). 3 Install the steering-indication marking plate (1) in the correct position.
