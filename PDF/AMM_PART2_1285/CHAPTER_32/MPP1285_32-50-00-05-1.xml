S.B.145-32-0002 or S/N 145-027 and on [1] For steering handle wheel commands (rudder pedal at neutral position) with deviations from the steering deflections specified in column "Maximum Steering Handle Wheel Deflection", it is necessary to make sure that the Part Number of the Nose Wheel Steering Electronic Control Module is correctly installed as related the nose landing gear strut configuration. (4) Push the steering handle wheel in the neutral position. (5) Release the steering handle wheel. (6) With the rudder pedal, command the rudder to the left stop and than to the right stop. The scale (in degrees) on the nose landing gear leg must indicate nose wheels position deflections as defined according to the maximum rudder pedal deflection column in (Table 501). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-004-A (1) Release all the pressure of hydraulic systems No. 1 and No. 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (2) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Remove the safety pins of the landing gears ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200) only before taxi and takeoff.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 32-50-00-700-804-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 5. NOSE WHEEL STEERING SYSTEM - COMPLETE ADJUSTMENT A. General (1) This task is recommend when: (a) The aircraft has a tendency to deviate to the left or right side during taxi, takeoff or landing. (b) There is a temporary solution ( AMM TASK 32-50-00-700-802-A/500) to help dispatch the aircraft, but this task is highly recommended to be used in case of repeater aircraft. B.

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Cockpit 1 Helps the other technician NLG I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-014-A (1) Make sure that the pressure in hydraulic systems No. 1 and No. 2 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (2) Make sure that the towbar is disconnected from the nose landing gear (NLG). (3) Make sure that the safety pins are installed on the landing gears ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (4) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). J. Nose Wheel Steering System - System Potentiometers check and adjustment NOTE: Do the check of the potentiometer and adjust only if necessary. SUBTASK 720-010-A (1) Do the check and adjustment of the Rudder Pedal Potentiometer (AMM TASK 32-50-02-700-801-A/500). (2) Do the check and adjustment of the Steering Handle Wheel Potentiometer (AMM TASK 32-50-01-700-801-A/500). (3) Do the check and adjustment of the Load Potentiometer (AMM TASK 32-50-05-700-801-A/500). (4) Do the check and adjustment of the Feedback Unit Potentiometer (AMM TASK 32-50-07-700-801-A/500). K. Nose Wheel Steering System - Feedback Unit Potentiometer adjustment (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 720-011-A (1) If the nose wheel misalignment occur when the handle wheel is pressed, do the adjustment as follows: (a) Identify the Feedback Unit Potentiometer (Figure 505) and remove the sealant from the cover (3).
