			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Clean the external surface of the wheel axle (2) with solvent RHODIASOLVE E-23. (3) Repair the damage or scratches, in the chrome-plated surface of the wheel axle (2), as follows: NOTE: The chrome plating of the wheel axle has a nominal thickness of 100 μm (4000 μin) and must have a thickness of 50 μm (2000  μin) or more to give sufficient corrosion protection to the axle. (a) Apply a 500 or 600-grit sandpaper and smooth out scratch or score. Keep the repair area as small as possible. NOTE: Be careful. Do not remove 50 μm (2000 μin) or more of the chromium. (b) Measure the depth of the damaged spot in the chrome-plated area of the wheel axle (2) that you have made smooth. NOTE: Make sure that the thickness of the chromium plating did not decrease more than 50 μm (2000 μin). (c) If the thickness of the chromium plating decreased more than 50 μm (2000  μin), replace the sliding tube assembly. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-20-08-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-20-08-400-801-A/400 for installation. NOTE: As an alternative, you can replace the nose landing gear leg.
