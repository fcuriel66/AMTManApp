			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) On the Circuit Breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (2) Fully release the pressure from the fluid chamber of the emergency/parking brake system hydraulic accumulator ( AMM TASK 32-44-02-910-801-A/200). (3) Remove access panel 193CR of hydraulic compartment 2 (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (4) Slowly open the charging valve of the nitrogen chamber of the hydraulic accumulator (1) to let all pressure in it go out. J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A CAUTION:TO DISCONNECT THE TUBES (3) AND (7), HOLD THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR (1) BY THE NEAREST FITTING WITH THE AID OF AN OPEN-END WRENCH. THIS WILL PREVENT THE TWIST OF THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR, WHICH CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO IT. REFER TO FIGURE 401. (1) Disconnect the hydraulic tubes (3) and (7). (2) Remove the lockwires (2) and (6). (3) Loosen the clamps (4) and (5). (4) Remove the hydraulic accumulator (1). CAUTION:TO LOOSEN THE FITTINGS (8) AND (11), HOLD THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR (1) BY THE NEAREST DRIVE POINT WITH THE AID OF AN 1 1/8-INCH OPEN-END WRENCH. THIS WILL PREVENT THE TWIST OF THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR, WHICH CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO IT. REFER TO FIGURE 402. (5) Remove and keep the fittings (8) and (11).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Put the hydraulic accumulator (1) in position in the clamps (4) and (5). CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT YOU APPLY THE CORRECT TORQUE ON THE HYDRAULIC TUBE. AN OVERTORQUE DURING THE ACCUMULATOR INSTALATION COULD CAUSE A DAMAGE TO THE INTERNAL ACCUMULATOR THAT WILL HAVE A LEAKAGE AS RESULT. (2) Connect the hydraulic tubes (3) and (7) and apply a torque of 15.3 to 16.4 N.m (135 to 145 lb.in) to the nuts. NOTE: To apply the torque to the nut of the hydraulic tube, hold the assembly by the nearest fitting with the aid of an open-end wrench. Refer to Figure 401. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT YOU APPLY THE CORRECT TORQUE ON THE CLAMPS. AN OVERTORQUE DURING THE ACCUMULATOR INSTALATION COULD CAUSE A DAMAGE TO THE INTERNAL ACCUMULATOR THAT WILL HAVE A LEAKAGE AS RESULT. (3) Tighten the clamps (4) and (5) to a torque of 4.5 N.m (40 lb.in) and safety them. K. Follow-on (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Pressurize the nitrogen chamber of the hydraulic accumulator (1) ( AMM TASK 32-44-02-600-801-A/300). (2) Use a brush to apply the leak detection fluid to the hydraulic-accumulator upper fitting and examine it for gas leakage. Refer to (Figure 403). (3) On the Circuit Breaker panel, close the ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (4) Pressurize hydraulic system 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (5) Do a check on the hydraulic accumulator assembly for oil leakage. (6) Install access panel 193CR of hydraulic compartment 2 (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (7) Bleed the Normal Brake and Emergency Parking Brake systems ( AMM TASK 32-40-00-800-801-A/200).
