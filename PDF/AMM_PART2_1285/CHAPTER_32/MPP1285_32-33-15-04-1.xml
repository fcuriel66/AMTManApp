			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING:THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 1 circuit breaker and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (2) Open access door 114CR of the nose hydraulic compartment (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Depressurize the hydraulic system 1 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (4) Fully release the pressure in the fluid chamber of the hydraulic accumulator of the landing-gear actuation system. For this, open the discharge valve and monitor the pressure gage until it shows the nitrogen precharge. (5) Slowly open the charging valve of the nitrogen chamber of the hydraulic accumulator to let all pressure in it go out. J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A CAUTION:TO DISCONNECT THE TUBES (2) AND (5), HOLD THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR (1) BY THE NEAREST FITTING WITH THE AID OF AN OPEN-END WRENCH. THIS WILL PREVENT THE TWIST OF THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR, WHICH CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO IT. REFER TO FIGURE 401. (1) Disconnect the hydraulic tubes (2) and (5). (2) Loosen the clamps (3) and (4). (3) Remove the hydraulic accumulator (1). CAUTION:TO LOOSEN THE FITTINGS (6) AND (9), HOLD THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR (1) BY THE NEAREST DRIVE POINT WITH THE AID OF AN 1 1/2-INCH OPEN-END WRENCH. THIS WILL PREVENT THE TWIST OF THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR, WHICH CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO IT. REFER TO FIGURE 402. (4) Remove and keep the fittings (6) and (9). (5) Remove and discard the old O-rings (7) and (8). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 32-33-15 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Nose hydraulic compartment I. Preparation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 841-003-A WARNING: THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) Lubricate new O-rings (7) and (8) and install them. CAUTION: TO APPLY THE TORQUE TO THE FITTING (6), HOLD THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR (1) BY THE NEAREST DRIVE POINT WITH THE AID OF AN 1 1/2-INCH OPEN-END WRENCH. THIS WILL PREVENT THE TWIST OF THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR, WHICH CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO IT. REFER TO FIGURE 402. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT YOU APPLY THE CORRECT TORQUE ON THE FITTING. AN OVERTORQUE DURING THE ACCUMULATOR INSTALATION COULD CAUSE A DAMAGE TO THE INTERNAL ACCUMULATOR THAT WILL HAVE A LEAKAGE AS RESULT. (2) Install fitting (6) and tighten it with a torque of 62.1 - 67.8 N.m (550 - 600 lb.in). CAUTION: TO APPLY THE TORQUE TO THE FITTING (9), HOLD THE HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR (1) BY THE NEAREST DRIVE POINT WITH THE AID OF AN 1 1/2-INCH OPEN-END WRENCH.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Connect the hydraulic tubes (2) and (5) and torque the nuts as written in Figure 401. NOTE: To apply the torque to the nut of the hydraulic tube, hold the assembly by the nearest fitting with the aid of an open-end wrench. Refer to Figure 401. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT YOU APPLY THE CORRECT TORQUE ON THE CLAMPS. AN OVERTORQUE DURING THE ACCUMULATOR INSTALATION COULD CAUSE A DAMAGE TO THE INTERNAL ACCUMULATOR THAT WILL HAVE A LEAKAGE AS RESULT. (3) Tighten the clamps (3) and (4) to a torque of 4.5 N.m (40 lb.in). K. Follow-on (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Charge the nitrogen chamber of the hydraulic accumulator (AMM TASK 12-13-06-600-801-A/300). (2) Use a brush to apply the leak detection fluid to the hydraulic-accumulator upper fitting and examine it for gas leakage. Refer to (Figure 403). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the ELEC PUMP 1 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (4) Do the bleed of air from the hydraulic system 1 lines ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-803- A/200). (5) Do a check on the hydraulic accumulator assembly for oil leakage. (6) Do an operational check of landing gear system ( AMM TASK 32-30-00-700-801-A/ 500). (7) Close access door 114CR of the nose hydraulic compartment (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100).
