			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Measure the diameter in two different positions, as shown in the figure. Write the values. (d) Calculate the average between the two values found in step (c), with this formula (all values in mm): M = (M1 + M2)/2, where: M1 = the first measurement M2 = the second measurement M = the average between the two measurements (e) Calculate the thickness of the laminated shims as follows (all values in mm): X = 61.922 - M. (f) Adjust the thickness of the laminated shims to the value "X" found in step (e). (g) Install the lower half-bearing again to the structure, but, at this time, together with the laminated shims. (h) Apply a torque of 50.80 to 56.45 N.m (450 to 500 lb.in) to the nuts. (i) Do step (c) and make sure that the values found are between 61.907 and 61.937 mm. (j) Do steps (a) thru (i) for the other lower half-bearing. (2) Procedure to find the thickness of the laminated washer of the NLG leg (Figure 402 and Figure 403). NOTE: • This procedure is applicable when the laminated washer is lost or damaged, or when the NLG leg is replaced. • The NLG leg has two solid spacer washers. The solid washer larger thickness is installed on the right side of the NLG leg. The solid washer smaller thickness is installed on the left side of the NLG leg together with the laminated washer. (a) With the NLG leg on GSE 102 and GSE 002, install the solid washer larger thickness and the ball joint bearing on the right side of the NLG leg. Refer to DET. B, Figure 402. (b) With the NLG leg on GSE 102 and GSE 002, install the solid washer smaller thickness and the ball joint bearing on the left side of the NLG leg, without the laminated washer. (c) Temporally install the NLG leg in the upper half-bearings with device GSE 002 and GSE 102. (d) Put the lower half-bearing in position. (e) Manually move the NLG leg to the right.

(4) Install the laminated washer adjusted in paragraph I.(2), the solid washer smaller thickness, and the ball joint bearing on the left side of the NLG leg. Refer to DET. B, Figure 403. CAUTION:AEROSHELL GREASE 22 MUST NOT BE MIXED WITH AEROSHELL GREASE 33. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, THE MIXTURE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENTS. (5) Apply grease to the lubrication channel of the NLG ball joint bearing. (6) Apply grease to the inner surface of the upper-half bearing and lower-half bearing (contact surface with the ball joint bearing). Refer to Figure 402 and Figure 403. (7) Enter in the applicable document the grease that you used. WARNING: COR-BAN 27L CORROSION-INHIBITING COMPOUND IS TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. USE GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE GLOVES. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. OBEY THE MANUFACTURER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. (8) Apply corrosion-inhibiting compound to the bolts and to the upper half-bearing (faying surface to the lower half-bearing). Refer to Figure 402 and Figure 403. (9) Put the NLG leg (3) in the upper half-bearings with the aid of GSE 002 and GSE 102. (10) Apply corrosion-inhibiting compound to the lower half-bearing (faying surface to the upper half-bearing). Refer to Figure 402 and Figure 403. (11) Put the lower half-bearing in position. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 32-20-01 Page 12 of 19 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
