Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Put the chocks against the landing gear wheels. Refer to AMM TASK 10-10-01-500-801-A/200. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (3) Control the rudder to the left and right until the pressure of the Hydraulic System 2 shows zero PSI in the EICAS. (4) Fully release the pressure from the fluid chamber of the Hydraulic Accumulator of the Emergency/ Parking Brake AMM TASK 32-44-02-910-801-A/200 (5) Remove access panel 192BR. Refer to AMM MPP 06-41-01/100. J. Operational Check of the Return Line Check Valve of the Emergency/Parking Brake System (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE GOGGLES AND RUBBER GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP (1) Disconnect the hydraulic tube (1) from the check valve (2). (2) Install the hex head plug (4) on the hydraulic tube (1). Refer to (Figure 501) or (Figure 502), as applicable. (3) Clean the threads of the open end of the check valve. (4) On the circuit breaker panel, remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker related to the Emergency/ Parking Brake system and close it. (5) Pressurize the hydraulic system 2. Refer to AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200 (6) Do a check for leakage on the open end of the check valve. NOTE: Wait 5 minutes and if you find any leakage on the check valve, you must replace it. (7) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to it.
