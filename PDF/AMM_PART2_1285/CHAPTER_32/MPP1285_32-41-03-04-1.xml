			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU ROUTE THE INBOARD AND OUTBOARD WHEEL-SPEED TRANSDUCER HARNESSES. A CROSS CONNECTION CAN CAUSE LOSS OF STEERABILITY. DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT AND INJURY TO PERSONNEL WILL THEN OCCUR. (1) To make sure that the inboard and outboard wheel-speed transducer harnesses are routed to the correct positions, do as follows: (a) Energize the aircraft. Refer to AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200. (b) Make sure that the BRAKES OUTBD circuit breaker is closed. (c) Open the BRAKES INBD circuit breaker (d) At the outboard wheel-speed transducer harness connector (P1051), with the aid of a multimeter, make sure that there is approximately 10 mA between contacts A and B. (e) At the inboard wheel-speed transducer harness connector (P1052), with the aid of a multimeter, make sure that the current is zero between contacts A and B. (f) Close the BRAKES INBD circuit breaker. (g) Deenergize the aircraft. (2) Connect the electrical connector (3) to the wheel speed transducer (2). NOTE: • Make sure that the wiring of the wheel speed transducer (2) is correctly installed. Connector P1051 must be at the outboard wheel and connector P1052 must be at the inboard wheel. • Before the installation of the connector, apply Lektro-Tech Super Corr-A into the plug connector to prevent corrosion and clean the contacts. (3) Before you push the wheel speed transducer (2) into the wheel axle, make sure that you rotate the wheel speed transducer until its groove is aligned with the pin of the wheel axle. (4) Install the speed transducer (2) on the wheel axle. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A CAUTION: • EXAMINE THE DRIVE CLIP FOR THE ATTACHMENT TO THE HUB CAP (1) AND FOR THE GAP. IF NECESSARY, THE GAP CAN BE ADJUSTED ( AMM TASK 32-49-02-200-801-A/600). • DAMAGE TO THE DRIVE CLIP CAN MAKE THE BRAKING EFFECT UNSATISFACTORY DURING THE TAXIING OF THE AIRCRAFT AT LOW SPEED (LESS THAN 25 KNOTS).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Do the functional check of the main brake system ( AMM TASK 32-41-00-700-801-A/ 500). (2) Put the hub cap (1) and gasket on the axle which moves the wheel speed transducer (2). Make sure that the hub-cap (1) drive clip is correctly engaged to the transducer driving axle. (3) Install the washers and bolts which attach the hub cap (1). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 32-41-03 Page 6 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
