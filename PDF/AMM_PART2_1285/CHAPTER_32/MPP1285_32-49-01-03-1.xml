			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 32-49-01-600-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. MLG WHEEL TIRE - CHECK AND CHARGE A. General (1) To do the check of the pressure of the tire, use only pressure gauges with a good precision. (2) For aircraft equipped with wheel pressure gauge, the check of the pressure can also be done with other external gauge, but do not use the wheel pressure gauge as a reference during inflation of the tire. (3) Incorrect pressure decreases the life of the tire and puts the airplane at risk. (4) Use the correct equipment to inflate the tire. (5) Install the relief valve to the pressure line as a safety device. B.

Check of MLG Tire Inflation Pressure (Figure 301)  SUBTASK 610-002-A (1) Remove the cap (1) from the valve (2). CAUTION: • DO NOT BLEED AIR FROM A HOT TIRE TO MAKE THE PRESSURE COME TO THE CORRECT LIMITS BECAUSE, AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, THE PRESSURE WILL BE LESS THAN THE CORRECT OPERATIONAL PRESSURE. • EXAMINE THE PRESSURE ONLY WHEN THE TIRE IS COLD. (2) Do the check of the service pressure: NOTE: There is no technical objection to the use of temperature-compensated pressure gauge to do the pressure check of a hot tire. But such equipment must give measurements equivalent to the cold tire pressure given in the AMM. Before the use of a temperature-compensated pressure gauge, refer to the Manufacturer's instructions applicable to the equipment. (a) For aircraft not equipped with wheel pressure gauge, connect the pressure gauge (3) to the valve (2). Refer to table 301. (b) For aircraft equipped with wheel pressure gauge, the check of the pressure can also be done with other external gauge. Refer to table 301.

NOTE: Loaded inflation pressure means inflation pressure for weight-on-wheel aircraft. Unloaded inflation pressure means inflation pressure for aircraft on jacks. (3) If there is a large temperature decrease between the departure and the destination airports, you must adjust the tire pressure for the colder airport before the flight. If the temperature difference is equal to or greater than 25ÃÂ°C (45ÃÂ°F), do this procedure: (a) Increase the tire pressure 1% for each 3ÃÂ°C (5.4ÃÂ°F) of temperature difference. 1 E. g.: Temperature at departure airport = 20ÃÂ°C (68ÃÂ°F) Temperature at arrival airport = -10ÃÂ°C (14ÃÂ°F) Temperature difference = 30ÃÂ°C (54ÃÂ°F) Increase the tire pressure: (30ÃÂ°C /3 x 1%) = 10% (54ÃÂ°F /5.4 x 1% = 10%) If the tire pressure is 145 psi, increase the tire pressure: 145 psi + 10% = 160 psi.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) If the pressure of one tire is at or near the lower limit of the permitted pressure range, it is recommended that you inflate the tire to an intermediate value in this pressure range to prevent unnecessary removals in subsequent pressure checks. For this, charge as given in item K ( AMM TASK 32-49-01-600-801-A/300). (5) For tire (4) with less than the minimum service pressure, refer to this table: Table 302 - COLD PRESSURE SETTING COLD TIRE SERVICE PRES- RECOMMENDED ACTION SURE (%) 100% to 105% of minimum loaded None - Normal cold tire operating range service pressure 95% to less than 100% of mini- Inflate to specified service pressure again mum loaded service pressure Examine tire/wheel assembly for cause of pres- sure loss. Inflate again and write the occurrence 90% to less than 95% of minimum in the applicable document. Remove tire/wheel loaded service pressure assembly if pressure loss is higher than 5% and [1] occurs again in 24 hours 80% to less than 90% of minimum Remove tire/wheel assembly from aircraft loaded service pressure Less than 80% of minimum loa- Remove tire/wheel assembly and adjacent tire/ ded service pressure wheel assembly from aircraft Discard tire. If the plug blows while in service Blown fuse plug (rolling), also scrap axle mate [1] The tire removed because of low inflation pressure must be examined by an authorized retreader to make sure that the casing did not have internal degradation. If it did, discard the tire. (6) Special Out-Station Procedure for tire (4) (Morning Cold Pressure Check Only). Refer to special parameters for dispatch of the aircraft as follows: (a) This procedure is only applicable to EMB-145LR (POST-MOD. SB 145-32-0030 or POST-MOD SB 145-32-0093, and PRE-MOD. SB 145-00-0032) versions which use H30x9.5-16 16PR tire: 1 Condition 1 - If the service pressure is between 148 psi and 156 psi. • Action - Reinflate to 164 psi. 2 Condition 2 - If the service pressure is between 140 psi and 148 psi and tire mate is within operating pressure limits. • Action - Reinflate to 164 psi. 3 Condition 3 - If the service pressure is between 125 psi and 140 psi and tire mate is within operating pressure limits. • Action 1 - Reinflate tire to 164 psi. • Action 2 - Remove the inflation source and, if no leaks are detected within 30 minutes, let the aircraft complete a maximum of two scheduled flights.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Adjust the outlet pressure of the nitrogen cylinder with 25% more than the nominal pressure of the tire given in Table 301 . NOTE: • After you adjust the pressure in the regulator, inflate the tire progressively, so as not to exceed the correct nominal pressure value. Then do the applicable adjustments: inflate or deflate the tires, as necessary. • This adjustment makes the tire servicing procedure quicker. K. Charge (Figure 302)  SUBTASK 610-003-A CAUTION: INFLATE THE TIRE WITH NITROGEN ONLY WHEN THE TIRE IS COLD. (1) Remove the cap (1) from the valve (2). (2) Connect the hose (3) to the valve (2). WARNING: • BEFORE THE SUBSEQUENT STEP, MAKE SURE THAT THE AREA IN FRONT OF THE TIRE IS CLEAR TO PREVENT POSSIBLE INJURY TO PERSONS DURING THE CHARGING OF THE TIRE (REFER TO THE FIGURE). • NEVER USE THE WHEEL PRESSURE GAUGE AS A REFERENCE DURING INFLATION OF THE TIRE. (3) Inflate the tire (4) and monitor the pressure with the pressure gauge (GSE 027 and GSE 028). Refer to Figure 302. (4) Disconnect the hose (3) from the valve (2). (5) Examine the valve (2) for leakage. (6) Install the cap (1) of the valve (2). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 600-801-A/300 32-49-01 Page 7 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
