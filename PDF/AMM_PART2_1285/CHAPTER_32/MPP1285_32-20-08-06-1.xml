			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Clean the external surface of the wheel axle with solvent RHODIASOLVE E-23. (4) Visually examine the external surface areas (non-chrome-plated area) of the axle (2), for corrosion, scratches, or other types of damage. If you see corrosion, scratches, or other types of damage, replace the sliding tube assembly. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-20-08-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-20-08-400-801-A/400 for installation. NOTE: As an alternative, you can replace the nose landing gear leg. Refer then to task AMM TASK 32-20-01-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-20-01-400-801-A/400 for installation. (5) Visually examine the inner (A) and outer (B) bearing seats, in the chrome-plated area of the axle (2), for signs of overheating. If you find signs of overheating, replace the sliding tube assembly. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-20-08-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-20-08-400-801- A/400 for installation.

(7) Visually examine the inner (A) and outer (B) bearing seats, in the chrome-plated area of the axle (2), for scratches or other types of damage. Do the check on all faces (top, forward, bottom, and aft) of the axle (2). If you see scratches or other types of damage, do as follows: (a) Measure the depth of the damaged spot in the chrome-plated area of the wheel axle (2). NOTE: The chrome plating of the wheel axle has a nominal thickness of 100 μm (4000 μin). (b) If the depth of the damaged spot is equal to or less than 50 μm (2000  μin), repair the surface protection. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-20-08-300-801-A/800. (c) If the damage depth is more than 50 μm (2000 μin) or the base metal is visible, replace the sliding tube assembly. For this, refer to AMM TASK 32-20-08-000-801-A/400 for removal and AMM TASK 32-20-08-400-801-A/400 for installation.
