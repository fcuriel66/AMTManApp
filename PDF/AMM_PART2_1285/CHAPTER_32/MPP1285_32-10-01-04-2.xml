Preparation SUBTASK 841-010-C (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 1, CMD, IND 1 and IND 2 circuit breakers and attach DO-NOT-CLOSE tags to them. (2) Control the rudder to the left and right until the pressure of the hydraulic system shows zero PSI on the EICAS. (3) Fully release the pressure from the fluid chamber of the emergency/parking brake system hydraulic accumulator ( AMM TASK 32-44-02-910-801-A/200). (4) Open access door 114CR of the nose hydraulic compartment (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) and release the pressure from the passenger door/LDG accumulator, installed in the nose hydraulic compartment. For this, open the discharge valve and monitor the pressure gage until it shows the nitrogen precharge. (5) Slowly open the charging valve of the nitrogen chamber of the hydraulic accumulator to let all pressure in it go out. (6) Make sure that the safety pins of the landing gears are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (7) Lift the aircraft on jacks. Refer to AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-801-A/200.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (5) Procedure to find the thickness of the laminated washer: NOTE: • This procedure is applicable when the laminated washer is lost or it is not possible to use it again, or when the MLG leg is replaced. • Each MLG leg has a laminated washer installed in the rear MLG articulation point. In the front MLG articulation point only the solid washer is installed. (a) Put the bearing in the rear MLG articulation point. Refer to DET. A, (Figure 401) or (Figure 403) as applicable to the aircraft configuration. (b) Put the lower half-bearings (7) in their installation position. (c) Push the MLG forward (in the direction of spar II) and measure the clearance with a feeler gage on the other side. Refer to (Figure 402) or (Figure 404) as applicable to the aircraft configuration. (d) Prepare the laminated washer with the necessary thickness to remove the clearance found in step (c). (e) Remove the MLG and remove the bearing from the rear MLG articulation point. (6) Put the laminated washer and bearing in the rear MLG articulation point. Refer to (Figure 401) or (Figure 403) as applicable to the aircraft configuration. CAUTION:AEROSHELL GREASE 22 MUST NOT BE MIXED WITH AEROSHELL GREASE 33. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, THE MIXTURE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENTS. (7) Fill the lubrication channel of the MLG bearing, upper and lower half-bearings with grease. Refer to (Figure 402) or (Figure 404) as applicable to the aircraft configuration. (8) Enter in the applicable document the grease that you used. WARNING: COR-BAN 27L CORROSION-INHIBITING COMPOUND IS TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. USE GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE GLOVES. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. OBEY THE MANUFACTURER’S HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. (9) Apply COR-BAN 27L on the upper half-bearing (contact surface with the lower half- bearing). Refer to (Figure 402) or (Figure 404) as applicable to the aircraft configuration. Apply it on the bolts (5) as required. Refer to (Figure 401) or (Figure 403) as applicable to the aircraft configuration. (10) Install the MLG again. (11) Apply COR-BAN 27L on the lower half-bearing (contact surface with the upper half- bearing). Refer to (Figure 402) or (Figure 404) as applicable to the aircraft configuration. (12) Put the lower half-bearing in its installation position. (13) For aircraft equipped with MLG with washers in the bolt head for installation of the lower and upper half-bearing, do as follows (Figure 401): EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 CONFIG-2 32-10-01 Page 13 of 15 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
