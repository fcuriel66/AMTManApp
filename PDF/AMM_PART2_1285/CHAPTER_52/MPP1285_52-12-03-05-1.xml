			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (5) On the HYD panel, set the SYS 1 ELECT PUMP switch to the ON position. (6) On the hydraulic compartment, make sure that the SYS 1 hydraulic accumulator is charged. (7) On the HYD panel, set the SYS 1 ELECT PUMP switch to the OFF position. (8) Push the CLOSE button of the internal control panel to close the main door. (a) Make sure that the BLOCKED light of the main-door internal control panel comes on. NOTE: • That means that the set point of the solenoid valve pressure switch is more than 2150 psi. • It is possible that, during the door closure operation, the BLOCKED lights comes on 2 seconds, approximately. This is a normal condition. (9) Open the door. (10) Remove the jumper from connector 1J7205 and install the connector. (11) Close floor panel 231CF. K.
