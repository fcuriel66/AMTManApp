(4) Remove the screws and washers from the cover of the upper middle cargo- compartment liner (29 positions) and the screws and washers from the cover of the upper forward cargo-compartment liner (19 positions). Refer to POST-MOD SB145-52-0012. (5) Pull the tension with your hands and, at the same time, lock the support and gears with a safety pin (ITEM GSE 208), (ITEM GSE 213). (6) Lock the mechanism with the safety pin. On aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-52-0012, use GSE 213 and, on aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-52-0012, use GSE 208. WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE GEAR IS LOCKED. IF NOT, INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (7) Remove the cotter pin, nut, washer, and bolt to disconnect the end of the cable from the support at the baggage-door structure ( AMM TASK 52-30-01-000-801-A/400). (8) Release the tension of the torsion bars of the compensating mechanism. WARNING: THE SUDDEN RETRACTION OF THE CABLE OF THE MECHANISM CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. (9) Pull the cable strongly and, at the same time, remove the safety pin and release the torsion bars. (10) Loosen the cable from the drum. Refer to (Figure 401) and (Figure 404). J. Removal of the Torsion Bar SUBTASK 020-002-A NOTE: Make sure that the torsion bars are installed straightly. (1) On aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-52-0012, remove the torsion bars (Figure 402) as follows: (a) Remove the cotter pins (7), washers (6), straight pins (4), and clamps (5) to release the torsion bars (8) and (10) from the supports (11) (2 positions). (b) If necessary, remove the nut (1) (3 positions), washer (2) (3 positions), and bolt (9) (3 positions) to remove the support (11) from the fuselage. (c) Remove the cotter pins (21), washers (20), straight pins (27), and clamps (19) to release the torsion bars (8) and (10) from the support (23). (d) If necessary, remove the nut (24) (3 positions), washers (25) (3 positions), and bolts (22) (3 positions) to remove the support (23) from the fuselage. (e) Remove the cotter pins (44) and straight pins (45) (2 positions) to disconnect the end of the torsion bars (8) and (10) from the compensating mechanism.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (o) Install the bolt (28), washer (29), nut (30), and a new cotter pin (31), to attach the pulley (32). WARNING:AN ACCIDENTAL RETRACTION OF THE CABLE OF THE MECHANISM CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. USE THE SAFETY PIN TO LOCK THE COMPENSATING MECHANISM. WARNING: IMPROPER ROUTING OF CABLE CAN RESULT IN DAMAGE TO STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS AND AIRCRAFT WIRING. (p) Install the bolt, nut, washer, and new cotter pin to connect the end of the cable to the support at the baggage door structure ( AMM TASK 52-30-01-400-801-A/ 400). NOTE: Make sure that the cargo door is open and properly supported before you route the counterbalance cable. (q) Check if the aft cable is wound clockwise on the cable drum. Route the cable from the cable drum through the hole in stringer 4r, which is positioned directly above the cable drum when the it is installed on the pinion (43) on the support (42). Make sure that the cable clearly passes over all wire bundles, fire extinguisher piping and control cables. Route the cable to the top of pulley (32) and under the two pin pulley guards (IPC 52-32-00, fig 12 item 40. NOTE: It is possible that you have to remove the pin pulley guards, to route the cable over the pulley (32); install pin pulley guards after routing cable over pulley (32). (r) From pulley (32) route cable to cargo door, make sure that the cable passes under any hydraulic lines and control cables that you can find between pulley (32) and cargo door.
