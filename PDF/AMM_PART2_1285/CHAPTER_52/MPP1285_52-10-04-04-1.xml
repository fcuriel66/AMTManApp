			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 402) (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 420-002-A NOTE: The rubber trim seal has four different sides refer to (Figure 402); sheet 1, DET. C): 1. The side (2) which is fitted into the door channel has the pressurization holes. 2. The wider side (3) is in contact with the door frame when the rubber trim is installed. 3. The narrower side (4) keeps its face upwards. 4. The chamfered side (5) is opposite to the side (2) fitted into the door channel. The filler strip is bonded to the chamfered side. (1) Install the rubber trim seal (1) to the door frame as follows: (a) Put the rubber trim seal on the door frame. NOTE: The rubber trim seal has a slope that must to be installed on the folding flap area. (b) Make sure that the narrower side of the rubber trim seal is turned up and the wider side is in contact with the door frame. (c) Make sure that the filler strip edge is in the same plane as the door side (Figure 402); sheet 2, DET. H) and (Figure 402); sheet 3, DET. G). (d) Manually install the middle point of the side to be fitted into the channel of the lower, upper, left, and right door sides. (e) With a plastic spatula, first install the rubber trim seal into the door channel from the lower and upper sides of the door structure. (f) With a plastic spatula install the left and the right sides of the rubber trim seal into the door channel. NOTE: When the rubber trim seal is installed, make sure that there is no different tensions along the rubber trim seal contour. (g) On the left and right door sides, find the eight holes in the door channel and make a mark on the rubber trim seal (Figure 403); DET. A). The marks must agree with the center of the identified holes and stay on the side to be fitted into the door channel (Figure 403); DET. B). (h) Remove from the door channel the part of the rubber trim seal in which the marks of the hole positions are. (i) Drill eight 4-mm (5/32-in) dia. holes in the rubber trim seal (1) (Figure 403); DET. B). (j) Put the part of the rubber trim seal in which the holes are on position back. (k) With a pressure applicator fill the link point of the rubber trim seal with sealant (2 positions) (Figure 402); sheet 1, DET. D), near the folding-flap articulation area. Stop the application when the sealant comes into view on the other side of the EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 52-10-04 Page 10 of 11 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL trim seal, like it was before the removal (Figure 402); sheet 2, DET. F) and (Figure 402); sheet 3, DET. E). NOTE: For a better finish of the sealant, you can soak your fingers in water-and- soap solution and pass them on the sealant that is applied. J. Follow-on (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 842-002-A NOTE: The aircraft can be dispatched 6 hours after the sealant application. (1) After 06 (six) hours, install the bolt (4) (21 positions), washer (2) (21 positions), and nut (1) (21 positions) to install the folding flap edge (3). NOTE: If it is necessary to replace the folding flap edge with a new edge, do as in ( AMM TASK 52-11-04-400-801-A/400). (2) Connect the fold-out rod as in item M (1) of (AMM TASK 52-00-00-910-801-A/200). (3) Put the internal handle in its opened position and have the cams controlled to the locked position (intermediate position). You can do this by hands refer to (Figure 202; sheet 2, DET. C) (b) of (AMM TASK 52-00-00-910-801-A/200). CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE STEPS ARE UNFOLDED, THE INTERNAL HANDLE IS IN THE OPEN POSITION, THE FOLD-OUT ROD IS INSTALLED, AND THE CAMS ARE IN THE LOCKED POSITION. (4) Hold the door while you remove the bench and get down the door, slowly. (5) Close the main door (AMM SDS 52-10-00/1). (6) Do a functional test for cabin leakage (AMM TASK 21-31-00-700-805-A/500) or (AMM TASK 21-31-00-700-808-A/500). If the leakage values are permitted, you can operate the aircraft.
