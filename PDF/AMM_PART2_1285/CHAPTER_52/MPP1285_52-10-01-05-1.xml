Main Door Internal Actuating Handle - Test (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 820-002-A (1) Cover the lower part of the internal handle with adhesive tape to protect the paint of the internal handle. (2) Pull the internal handle until the folding flap opens. Refer to Figure 501; DET. A. NOTE: Do not unlock the door. (3) Put the dynamometer against the internal handle, approximately 30 mm from the internal handle edge. Refer to Figure 501; DET. B. (4) Use the dynamometer to push the internal handle from the open-folding flap position to the unlock-door position. Refer to Figure 501; DET. B. NOTE: Make sure that the dynamometer is perpendicular to the internal handle all along the handle travel. (5) Record the maximum load indicated on the dynamometer. (6) Do steps 2 to 5 again and again, a minimum of three times, to get the average load. The average load must not be more than 50 lb (22.68 kgf). (7) If the average load is more than 50 lb (22.68 Kgf), or if a smaller load is required, you must do the adjustment of the main door. Refer to FIM 52-11-00. NOTE: If a lower average load is desired to ease/soften door operation, you must do the adjustment of the main door. Refer to FIM 52-11-00. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the adhesive tape from the internal handle. (2) Close the main door (AMM SDS 52-10-00/1). NOTE: The step tread must be deployed before you close the main door.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Open the main door (AMM SDS 52-10-00/1). (2) Support the door with a bench at the correct height (AMM TASK 52-00-00-910-801-A/ 200). (3) With the steps fully deployed, do a check of the spring of each step. They must not be tensioned or twisted. Refer to Figure 502. (a) A tensioned spring indicates that the shaft of the step or the spring support is wrongly installed. Remove the shaft of the step and install it back correctly ( AMM TASK 52-10-03-400-801-A/400 and/or AMM TASK 52-11-05-400-801-A/400). J. Main-Door Step Actuating Mechanism - Adjustment (Figure 503)  (Figure 504)  (Figure 505)  (Figure 506)  SUBTASK 820-003-A CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE STEP ACTUATING ARM DOES NOT TOUCH THE ROLLER BACKSTOP (Figure 503; SHEET 2; DET. D). (1) Make sure that the distance between the fold-out backstop and the door stop is between 88 mm (3.46 in) and 90 mm (3.54 in) (Figure 503; Sheet 2; DET. D). If required, adjust the distance between the stops, as follows (refer to Figure 503; Sheet 1 and 2): NOTE: It is necessary to keep a minimum load on the roller backstop to prevent damage to the fold-out backstop. (a) Remove the thermoacoustic blanket (12). (b) Loosen the bolts (10). It is not necessary to remove them. (c) Move the fold-out backstop (11) upward or downward, as necessary, and tighten the bolts (10). NOTE: The distance between the fold-out backstop (11) and the door stop must be between 88 mm (3.46 in) and 90 mm (3.54 in) (Figure 503; Sheet 2; DET. D). (d) Install the thermoacoustic blanket (12). (2) There are two different conditions in which the adjustment of the main-door step actuating mechanism can be done. • If there is a rig hole on the bellcrank (Figure 504; DET. B), do SUBTASK 820-004-A. • If there is no rig hole on the bellcrank (Figure 504; DET. B), do SUBTASK 820-005-A. SUBTASK 820-004-A EFFECTIVITY: FOR BELLCRANCK WITH RIG HOLE (3) Adjust the rod A as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 820-802-A/500 52-10-01 Page 6 of 70 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: This procedure can be done with the aircraft on jacks. However, it is strongly recommended that this procedure be done with the aircraft on the landing gears. (2) If the folding flap edge, or the folding flap, is a new one, remove the folding flap edge ( AMM TASK 52-11-04-400-801-A/400) to avoid interference as it is not adjusted yet. J. Main Door-to-Fuselage Skin Step - Adjustment SUBTASK 820-015-A (1) If the adjustment of the main door-to-fuselage skin gap was not done, the check points are not marked on the fuselage, do as follows: (a) Open the door (AMM SDS 52-10-00/1). (b) Identify the check points with adhesive tape on the fuselage skin. Check points 1 to 10 are aligned with the stop seats (refer to Figure 521, DET. B). Check points 11 and 12 are located 120 mm below the folding flap top. Check points 13 and 14 are located in the vertical center line of the door, as shown in Figure 518. (2) Close and lock the main door (AMM SDS 52-10-00/1). NOTE: The step tread must be deployed before you close the main door. (3) Measure the steps between the door contour and the fuselage loft line and compare them with the values shown in Table 502. NOTE: If the door has a new folding flap edge ( AMM TASK 52-11-04-400-801-A/ 400), it must not be installed on the door, and the measurement at points 12 and 13 will be done after the installation of the folding flap edge. Table 502 - PERMITTED STEPS - AIRCRAFT DEPRESSURIZED Minimum permitted Maximum permitted step Points step (mm) (mm) 1 to 10 - 0.5 - 4.0 12 0.0 - 5.0 13 - 4.5 - 9.5 14 0.0 - 3.0 NOTE: • The negative sign of the step value means that the door is underflush to the fuselage skin line. • The step at point 11 does not need to be measured because of the reinforcement interference. (4) If the step values are in the tolerance, it is not necessary to adjust the step. (5) If a discrepancy is found, do as follows: (a) Displace the lower and upper rollers, either inward or outward as required. Release the rollers as described in AMM TASK 52-10-01-820-806-A/500.

If it is not sufficient, try to adjust the steps at these points by turning the eccentric bolts ( AMM TASK 52-10-01-820-807-A/500). (c) Close the door carefully to ensure the free movement of the rollers into the tracks ( AMM TASK 52-10-01-820-806-A/500). (d) Lock the door and touch the lower rollers with your finger and try to turn them. They must turn freely ( AMM TASK 52-10-01-820-806-A/500).

(4) If you find the specified gap on all stops, there is no need for adjustment. (5) If a stop is out of tolerance, adjust its gap as follows: (a) Open the door (AMM SDS 52-10-00/1). (b) Adjust the stops (10x) (Figure 521; DET. D) as follows: 1 Remove the nut (4), screw (1), shims (3) and stop (2) from the support. 2 Remove or install more shims (3) as necessary. 3 Install the shims (3), if applicable, stop (2), screw (1) and nut (4) at the support.
