			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Have the cams controlled to the intermediate position. You can do this by hands and put the internal handle in its closed position. (3) Remove the bolt (1) (21 positions), washer (3) (21 positions), and nut (4) (21 positions) to release the folding flap edging (2). NOTE: If it is necessary to replace the folding flap edging with a new edging, do as in item J (3) of AMM MPP 52-18-03/400. J. Removal (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 020-002-A CAUTION: DO NOT USE SHARP-EDGED TOOLS TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE RUBBER TRIM SEAL OR TO THE METALLIC SURFACES OF THE DOOR FRAME. (1) Remove the rubber trim seal (1) as follows: (a) Slowly pull the rubber trim seal from the door groove. NOTE: The rubber trim seal has two link points near the articulation of the folding flap (refer to DET. C): • To prevent damage to the rubber trim seal, cut these two link points very carefully. • Make sure that you know the correct seal position. This will help you during the installation procedure. (b) Remove the rubber trim seal (1). WARNING: USE SEALANT OR SOLVENT IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. AVOID VAPOR INHALATION AND LONG SKIN CONTACT WITH THESE PRODUCTS. (c) Clean the area of the door frame near the link point of the folding flap (2 positions) to remove the remaining sealant. (d) If necessary, repair the rubber trim seal ( AMM TASK 52-00-04-300-801-A/800). (e) If necessary, repair the top or bottom filler strips ( AMM TASK 52-00-01-300-801- A/800).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 402) (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 420-002-A NOTE: The rubber trim seal has four different sides (refer to (Figure 402), DET. E): 1. The side (2) which is fitted into the door channel has the pressurization holes. 2. The wider side (3) is in contact with the door frame when the rubber trim is installed. 3. The narrower side (4) keeps its face upwards. 4. The chamfered side (5) is parallel to the side (2) fitted into the door channel. The filler strip is bonded to the chamfered side. (1) Install the rubber trim seal (1) on the door frame as follows: (a) Put the rubber trim seal (1) on the door frame. NOTE: The rubber trim seal has a slope that must be installed on the folding flap area. (b) Make sure that the chamfered side of the rubber trim seal (1) is turned up. (c) Make sure that the filler strip of the rubber trim seal (1) is parallel to the folding flap side (refer to (Figure 403), sheet 1, DET. D). (d) Make sure that the rubber side (not the fiber side) of the filler strip at the bottom of the door and the fiber side of the filler strip at the top of the door touches the fuselage seal, when the door is closed. (e) Make sure that the two drain holes of the rubber trim seal (1) are at the bottom of the door (refer to (Figure 403), sheet 1, DET. B). (f) Manually install the middle point of the side to be fitted into the channel of the lower, upper, left, and right door sides. (g) With a plastic spatula, first install the rubber trim seal into the door channel from the lower and upper sides of the door structure. (h) With a plastic spatula, install the left and the right sides of the rubber trim seal into the door channel. NOTE: When the rubber trim seal is installed, make sure that there are no different tensions along the rubber trim seal contour. (i) On the left and right door sides, find the eight holes in the door channel and make marks on the rubber trim seal (Figure 403), sheet 2, VIEW C). The marks must agree with the center of the identified holes and stay on the side to be fitted into the door channel (Figure 403), sheet 2, DET. F). (j) Remove from the door channel the part of the rubber trim seal on which the marks of the hole positions are. (k) Drill eight 4-mm (5/32-in) dia. holes in the rubber trim seal (Figure 403), sheet 2, DET. F).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (l) Put the part of the rubber trim seal in which the holes are, back into position. (m) With a pressure applicator, fill the link point of the rubber trim seal with sealant (2 positions) (Figure 402), DET. C), near the folding-flap articulation area. Stop the application when the sealant comes into view on the other side of the trim seal, as it was before the removal. NOTE: For a better finish of the sealant, you can soak your fingers in water-and- soap solution and pass them on the applied sealant. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A NOTE: The aircraft can be dispatched 6 hours after the sealant application (1) After 06 (six) hours, install the bolt (1) (21 positions), washer (3) (21 positions), and nut (4) (21 positions) to install the folding flap edging (2). NOTE: If it is necessary to replace the folding flap edging with a new edging, do as in item J (3) of AMM MPP 52-18-03/400. (2) Put the internal handle in its open position and have the cams controlled to the locked position. You can do this by hand. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERNAL HANDLE IS IN THE OPEN POSITION AND THE CAMS ARE IN THE LOCKED POSITION. (3) Close the side-hinged main door. (4) Do a functional test for cabin leakage (AMM TASK 21-31-00-700-805-A/500 or AMM TASK 21-31-00-700-808-A/500). If the leakage values are permitted, you can operate the aircraft.
