			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: The cable tension can be adjusted with the baggage door installed in the aircraft or not. (c) Apply a tension of 70 ÃÂ± 5 lb to the cables of the actuating and locking mechanism of the baggage door, with the baggage door closed. (Refer to Figure 508). NOTE: Cable diameter is 5/32 in (3.97 mm). (d) Pull the vent panel through the locking handle (Figure 501): 1 The vent panel stays closed by spring action. 2 The locks (1) (Figure 502) must be engaged with the recesses of the upper cranks (2) (forward and aft upper cranks). If not, adjust the cables as follows: a Put the rig pin (1) (Figure 503) in the support and bellcrank holes (2). If it is not possible, cut the lockwires (5) of the rods (6), remove the cotter pin (10), nut (9), washers (8), and bolt (7) which attach the each rods and turn the rods until you can put the rig pin in the holes. b Install the bolt, washers, nut, and a new cotter pin to attach each rods. c Install the new lockwire if it was removed. d Cut the clips (3) to release the cables. e Turn the turnbuckles (4) to loosen the two cables of each lock. f Make sure that the lock is engaged with the recess of the upper cranks (6) (forward and aft upper cranks). g Turn the turnbuckle of the cable which permits the lock to start to move away from the recess of the upper crank. h Turn the other turnbuckle until the lock lightly touches the recess of the upper crank. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE CA-1000-NC BECAUSE IT IS TOXIC. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE IT. DO NOT BREATHE ITS GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. i Apply CA-1000-NC, during the connection of the turnbuckles, if they were disconnected ( AMM TASK 52-31-00-000-801-A/400). j Remove the rig pin and put it in the lock hole to make sure that the lock is in the correct position. k If it is very difficult to remove the rig pin or if the locks are not engaged in the recesses of the upper cranks, adjust the cables directly. l Make sure that the locks are engaged in the recesses of the upper cranks.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL m Look at the red mark on the microswitch actuation pin. If it is out of the correct values, away from the microswitch support, adjust the baggage door warning microswitches ( AMM TASK 52-76-01-820-801-A/500). 3 Push the vent panel through the locking handle: a The vent panel stays open by spring action. 4 If applicable, install the baggage door ( AMM TASK 52-30-01-400-801-A/ 400). (e) Install the baggage door if it was removed from the fuselage ( AMM TASK 52-30-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Check and adjustment of the step of the baggage door (Figure 504 and Figure 505). (a) Fully close and lock the baggage door (AMM SDS 52-30-00/1). (b) From the outside of the aircraft, do a check of the step values between the door and the fuselage frame for each point (Figure 504). Table 501 Permitted Step Check Points Minimum Maximum 1 to 9 -3.0 mm (-0.12 in) 0.0 mm (0.00 in) 11 and 13 -3.0 mm (-0.12 in) 0.0 mm (0.00 in) 10, 12, and 14 Not Controlled (c) If the step values are satisfactory and it does not take too much power to open and close the door, go to step (3). If the values are unsatisfactory, adjust the door step as follows (Figure 505): 1 Remove the lockwire, the bolt, and the lock from the four door rollers (DET. B in Figure 505). 2 From the inside of the aircraft, one technician operates GSE 339 (DET. C in Figure 505) while the other technician, outside the aircraft, does the check of the step values. NOTE: Make sure that the step obeys the permitted values and the door is not hard to open or close. 3 Go back to step (b). (3) Check and adjustment of the gap of the baggage door (Figure 504, Figure 506 and Figure 507). (a) Fully close and lock the baggage door (AMM SDS 52-30-00/1). (b) From the inside of the aircraft, measure the gap between the door guide and the fuselage (Figure 507).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: • Gap or interference permitted between the door guide and the fuselage is 1.0 mm (+0.0 mm; -0.5 mm) (Figure 507). • If necessary, remove or add shims between the guide and the door (DET. D in Figure 506), as applicable, to get gap or interference between the door guide and the fuselage. (c) From the outside of the aircraft, do a check of the gap values between the do or and the fuselage frame for each point (Figure 504). Table 502 Permitted Gap Check Points Minimum Maximum 1 to 8 1.0 mm (0.04 in) 5.0 mm (0.20 in) 9, 11, and 13 2.0 mm (0.08 in) 7.0 mm (0.28 in) 10, 12, and 14 1.0 mm (0.04 in) 6.0 mm (0.24 in) (d) If the gap obeys the permitted values, the adjustment is completed. If not, adjust the door gap as follows (Figure 506): 1 Remove the door to remove or add shims under the guides ( AMM TASK 52-30-01-000-801-A/400). 2 For horizontal gap adjustments (Points 1 thru 8 in Figure 504), remove or add shims between the door and the door guides as applicable (DET. D in Figure 506). NOTE: • If you add a shim on one side, you must remove the shim from the other side. • Make sure, after the adjustment, that the gap or interference between the door guide and the fuselage is 1.0 mm (+0.0 mm; -0.5 mm) (Figure 507). 3 For vertical gap adjustments (Points 9 thru 14 in Figure 504), remove or add shims between the door and the door roller support as applicable (DET. B and DET. C in Figure 506). NOTE: If you add a shim on the top, you must remove the shim from the bottom. 4 Install the door ( AMM TASK 52-30-01-400-801-A/400). 5 Go back to step (c). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the baggage door lining ( AMM TASK 25-51-02-400-801-A/400). (2) Connect the cable of the door lifting and lowering mechanism, according to AMM TASK 52-32-00-400-801-A/400.
