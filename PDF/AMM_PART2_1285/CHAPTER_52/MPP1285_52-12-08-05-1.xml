			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Depressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (4) Fully release the pressure in the fluid chamber of the hydraulic accumulator of the main-door actuation system. For this, open the discharge valve and monitor the pressure gage until it shows the nitrogen precharge. (5) Release the pressure in the spring accumulator. For this, do the steps below: (a) Open the main-door emergency valve in the cockpit. (b) Manually open and close the main door for two or three times. (6) Remove floor panels231BF and 231CF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). J. Adjustment (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 820-002-A WARNING:THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) Remove the cotter pin, castellated nut, washers, and bolt to disconnect the rod end of the actuator from the rotating arm. (2) Extend the actuator rod to its maximum travel. CAUTION: AS A CHECK OF THE ROD ENDS FOR SECURITY, PUT A PIN OF THE APPLICABLE DIAMETER INTO THE INSPECTION HOLE OF THE ROD END. THE PIN MUST NOT GO THROUGH THE ROD END. (3) Adjust the actuator rod end to let the center of the actuator rod lug stay 0.12 ÃÂ± 0.02 in (3.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 mm) forward of the center of the main-door rotation arm attachment hole. (4) Put the actuator rod at the door rotation arm. (5) Install the bolt, washers, castellated nut and cotter pin to attach the actuator rod to the main-door rotating arm. (6) Do the actuator operational test. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, close the ELEC PUMP 1 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (2) Pressurize hydraulic system 1 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (3) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations of the Aircraft Maintenance Program.
