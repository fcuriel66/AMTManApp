			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Totally release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (4) Totally release the pressure from the fluid chamber of the hydraulic accumulator of the main-door actuation system. For this, open the discharge valve and monitor the pressure gage until it shows the nitrogen precharge. (5) Release the pressure from the spring accumulator. For this, do the steps below: (a) Open the main-door emergency valve in the cockpit. (b) Manually open and close the main door two or three times. (6) Identify the check valve to be removed. J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING:THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) Remove the low pressure check valve as follows: (a) Disconnect the hydraulic tube assembly (4) from the check valve (3). (b) Remove the check valve (3) from the hydraulic tube assembly (1). (c) Remove and discard the old O'ring (2). (2) Remove the high pressure check valve as follows: (a) Disconnect the hydraulic tube (4) from the check valve (3). (b) Remove the check valve (3) from the fitting block (1). (c) Remove and discard the old O'ring (2).
