Preparation (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. I. Functional Test of the Reinforced Cockpit Door Blow-out Panel (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Open the cockpit door. (2) Do a test on the blow-out panel (4) as an escape panel, as follow (refer to Figure 502, DET. A, sheet 1): (a) Remove the latch cover (2) to get access to the bottom retainer (3). (b) Rotate the bottom retainer (3) counterclockwise to release the blow-out panel (4). Refer to DET. C. (c) Carefully, pull the blow-out panel (4) to make sure that its opens smoothly.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (d) Fit the blow-out panel (4) in its original position. (e) Turn the bottom retainer (3) clockwise to close the blow-out panel (4). (f) Do steps (a) thru (e) two or three times to make sure that the blow-out panel (4) operates correctly as an escape panel. (3) Do a functional test on the pressure relief latch (5), as follows (refer to Figure 502, sheet 2): (a) Close the cockpit door (1). CAUTION:BEFORE YOU DO THE FUNCTIONAL TEST OF THE PRESSURE RELIEF LATCH, MAKE SURE THAT 0.635 mm (0.025 in) IS THE MAXIMUM PRELOAD POSITION OF THE LATCH BOLT. THIS WILL PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE LATCH AIR CYLINDER LOCKING PIN. (b) Use adhesive tape (8) to cover two or three pressure sense holes on the pressure relief latch (5). Refer to DET. C and D, sheet 2. NOTE: Before you use GSE 430 for the first time, trim the tip of the tool as necessary. (c) On the pressure relief latch (5), put the vacuum tip of GSE 430 in the remaining open pressure sense hole. Refer to DET. D. NOTE: During the functional test, the vacuum tip of GSE 430 must be in full contact with the pressure sense hole for in accurate test of the pressure relief latch (5). (d) Squeeze the handle of the GSE 430 to get a vacuum of between 80 kPa (11.60 lbf/in) and 40 kPa (5.80 lbf/in) (e) Let the gauge bleed off the vacuum slowly by itself until it gets the range between 40 kPa (5.80 lbf/in) and 10 kPa (1.45 lbf/in). (f) When the gauge of GSE 430 gets the range between 40 kPa (5.80 lbf/in) and 10 kPa (1.45 lbf/in), use GSE 431 to open the latch bolt as follows: CAUTION: WHEN YOU USE GSE 431, MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A MINIMUM OF 10 kPa (1.45 lbf/in) ON THE VACUUM GAUGE. THIS PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE LATCH-AIR-CYLINDER LOCKING PIN. 1 Fit GSE 431 into the hole in the latch bolt. Refer to DET. D. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE VACUUM TIP OF GSE 430 IS IN FULL CONTACT WITH THE HOLE. 2 Use GSE 431 to turn the latch 90ÃÂ° from the closed position to the open position. 3 If the latch bolt opens in the range of 40 kPa (5.80 lbf/in) and 10 kPa (1.45 lbf/in), the latch bolt is serviceable.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 4 If the latch bolt does not open in the range of 40 kPa (5.80 lbf/in) and 10 kPa (1.45 lbf/in), the latch bolt is not serviceable. (g) Put the latch bolt back to its closed position. (h) Remove GSE 431. (i) Do steps (d) thru (h) two or three times to make sure that the pressure relief latch (5) operates correctly and the latch bolt opens. (j) Remove GSE 430 from the pressure sense holes. (k) Go to step (4). CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT GSE 430 IS REMOVED FROM THE PRESSURE RELIEF LATCH (5). (4) Fit GSE 431 into the hole in the latch bolt. Refer to DET. D. CAUTION: DO NOT USE FORCE TO OPEN THE LATCH BOLT. (a) Try to turn the latch bolt to the open position to make sure that the locking mechanism is fully engaged. 1 The latch bolt must turn maximum 5ÃÂ° before a solid stop is felt as the latch bolt finds the locking mechanism. (5) Remove GSE 431 from the latch bolt. (6) Remove the adhesive tape (8). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-802-A/500 52-51-01 Page 8 of 10 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
