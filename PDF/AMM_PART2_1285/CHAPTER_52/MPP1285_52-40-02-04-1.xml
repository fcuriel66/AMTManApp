			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. NOTE: The sealant curing time will change because of the environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01. (b) Acceleration of the sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: The sealant curing time versus temperature rate changes as shown in the Sealant Specification Table (SRM 51-20-01). (c) Application of aluminum tape after the tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as written in paragraph (b). 3 After the sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 150 hours. (d) Application of polyethylene film and aluminum tape. 1 Apply sealant P/S 870 - B 1/2 or P/S 870 - B 2. 2 Apply a polyethylene film over the sealant. 3 Apply the aluminum tape. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 10 days.
