			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Open access door 114CR of the nose hydraulic compartment (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Depressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (4) Fully release the pressure from the fluid chamber of the hydraulic accumulator of the main-door actuation system. For this, open the discharge valve and monitor the pressure gage until it shows the nitrogen precharge. (5) Release the pressure from the spring accumulator. For this, do the steps below: (a) Open the main-door emergency valve in the cockpit. (b) Manually open and close the main door two or three times. J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING:THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) Disconnect the hydraulic tube (3). (2) For aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-52-0016, do as follows: (a) Remove the pressure relief valve (4) and the hydraulic connection (10) from the fitting block (1). (b) Remove and discard the old O-ring (2). (c) Remove the hydraulic connection (10) from the pressure relief valve (4). (d) Remove and discard the old O-ring (9). (3) For aircraft POST-MOD SB145-52-0016, do as follows: (a) Remove the pressure relief valve (4) from the fitting block (1). (b) Remove and discard the old O-ring (2). (4) Disconnect the hydraulic tube (7). (5) Remove the thermal relief valve (8) from the fitting block nose (5). (6) Remove and discard the old O-ring (6).
