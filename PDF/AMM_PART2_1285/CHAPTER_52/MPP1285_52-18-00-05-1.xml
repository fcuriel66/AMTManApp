			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Main Door-to-Fuselage Skin Gap - Test (Figure 512)  (Figure 513)  SUBTASK 820-010-A (1) Do a check of the gaps of the main door as follows: (a) The folding flap edge must be installed on the door (AMM TASK 52-18-03-400-801-A/400). (b) Open the main door (AMM SDS 52-18-00/1). (c) Identify the check points with adhesive tape on the fuselage skin. Check points 1 to 10 are aligned with the stop seats (Figure 516, DET. B). Check points 11 and 12 are 120 mm below the folding flap top. Check points 13 and 14 are in the vertical center line of the door, as shown in Figure 512. CAUTION: DO NOT USE THE RED INTERNAL HANDLE TO PULL OR PUSH THE DOOR. BEFORE YOU CLOSE THE DOOR, MAKE SURE THAT THE INTERNAL HANDLE IS IN THE FULLY VERTICAL POSITION. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THESE PRECAUTIONS, DAMAGE TO THE LOCKING MECHANISM CAN OCCUR. (d) Close and lock the main door (AMM SDS 52-18-00/1). (e) Measure the gaps between the door contour and the frame on the fuselage structure, at the check points, and compare them with the values shown in Table 501. NOTE: Keep the parallelism on one of the sides of the main door. Table 501 - PERMITTED GAPS - AIRCRAFT DEPRESSURIZED Maximum permitted gap Minimum permitted gap Points (mm) (mm) 1 to 10, 13 and 14 5.0 1.0 11 and 12 7.0 5.0 (f) If the gaps between the door contour and the frame, at the points 1 to 12, are not correct, or other part of the main door touches the frame or other device attached in the frame, adjust the gaps with the upper and lower lateral guides (SUBTASK 52-18-00-820-010-A00). For a larger adjustment, adjust the gaps with the upper and lower bars (SUBTASK 52-18-00-820-011-A00). NOTE: The main door must enter freely when it is closed. Only the upper and lower lateral guides can touch the lateral guide seats. NOTE: When the door closes, the gap between the upper stops (Figure 517, Sheet 2) and the stop seats is a good reference to adjust the gap from inside the aircraft. (g) If the gaps between the door contour and the frame, at the points 13 and 14, are not correct, adjust the gaps/door-height with the support link (SUBTASK 52-18-00-820-012-A00).
