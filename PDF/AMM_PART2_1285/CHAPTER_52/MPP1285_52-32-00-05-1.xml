			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Remove the screws and washers (29 positions - refer to POST-MOD SB145-52-0012) of the cover of the upper middle cargo-compartment liner to get access to the compensating mechanism drum, only to adjust the baggage-door lifting and lowering mechanism. (2) Remove headliner panel 273BTC ( AMM MPP 06-41-05/100) to get access to the compensating mechanism drum, only to adjust the baggage-door lifting and lowering mechanism. Refer to PRE-MOD SB145-52-0012. J. Adjustment/Test (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 820-002-A (1) On aircraft PRE-MOD SB145-52-0012, do the operational test of the baggage-door lifting and lowering mechanism as follows: NOTE: When you replace only one torsion bar, the tension of the other torsion bar must be released before the adjustment of the lifting and lowering mechanism is complete. (a) Do a check of the cable tension ( AMM TASK 52-32-00-200-801-A/600). (b) If the cable tension is 80 ÃÂ± 5 lb, the adjustment is finished. (c) If the cable tension is not 80 ÃÂ± 5 lb, adjust the tension as follows: (d) Fully open the baggage door. (e) Make sure that the door moves without metal-to-metal rubbing. (f) Pull the tension cable down with your hands and, at the same time, lock the support and gears with a safety pin (ITEM GSE 213) (Figure 501). (g) Slowly move the door down until one of the gear holes is aligned with the support hole behind the drum. WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE GEAR IS LOCKED. IF NOT, INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (h) Lock the mechanism with the safety pin. (i) Move the door up and put the lifting rod on the fuselage resting support. (j) Remove the cotter pin, nut, and washer that attach the drum to the mechanism (DET. D in Figure 501). (k) Remove the drum. (l) If the cable tension is less than 80 ÃÂ± 5 lb: 1 Turn the drum clockwise. (m) If the cable tension is more than 80 ÃÂ± 5 lb: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 820-801-A/500 52-32-00 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 1 Turn the drum counterclockwise. (n) Install the drum in the mechanism. (o) Install the washer and nut to attach the drum to the mechanism (DET. D in Figure 501). WARNING: HOLD THE CABLE STRONGLY. IF NOT, INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (p) Pull the tension cable down with your hands and, at the same time, remove the safety pin from the support and gears (Figure 501). (q) Do a check of the cable tension ( AMM TASK 52-32-00-200-801-A/600). (r) If the tension is not 80 ÃÂ± 5 lb, go back to step (e). If it is correct, do step (s). (s) Install the cotter pin in the drum (DET. D in Figure 501). (2) On aircraft POST-MOD SB145-52-0012, do the baggage door compensating test/ adjustment procedure as follows (Figure 502): (a) Do a check of the cable tension ( AMM TASK 52-32-00-200-801-A/600). (b) If the cable tension is 100 ÃÂ± 5 lb, the adjustment is finished. (c) If the cable tension is not 100 ÃÂ± 5 lb, adjust the tension as follows: (d) Fully open the baggage door. (e) Make sure that the door moves freely along the tracks. (f) Pull the tension cable down with your hands and, at the same time, lock the support and gears with a safety pin (ITEM GSE 208) (Figure 502). (g) Slowly move the door down until one of the gear holes is aligned with the support hole behind the drum. WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE GEAR IS LOCKED. IF NOT, INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (h) Lock the mechanism with the safety pin. (i) Move the door up and put the lifting rod on the fuselage resting support. (j) Remove the cotter pin, nut, and washer that attach the drum to the mechanism (DET. D in Figure 502). (k) Remove the drum. (l) If the cable tension is less than 100 ÃÂ± 5 lb: 1 Turn the drum clockwise. (m) If the cable tension is more than 100 ÃÂ± 5 lb: 1 Turn the drum counterclockwise.
