			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) With the aircraft in the discharged condition, remove the rear electronic-compartment door ( AMM TASK 52-44-01-000-801-A/400). J. Adjustment of the Rear Electronic-Compartment Door (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 820-002-A (1) There are three different conditions in which the adjustment of the rear electronic- compartment door is necessary. (a) Installation of a new rear electronic-compartment door. Do steps 2 thru 10. (b) Removal of the rear electronic-compartment door from an aircraft and installation of it on other aircraft. Do steps 2 thru 10. (c) Incorrect adjustment of a rear electronic-compartment door removed and installed on the same aircraft. Do steps 3 thru 10. (2) Do a check to see if there is a shim under the supports and under the guides (Figure 502). Remove the shims and keep them in a safe location because they will be used to adjust the door. (3) Remove the latch installed on the fuselage. (4) Install the door ( AMM TASK 52-44-01-400-801-A/400). (5) Do a check of the gap and step values between the door and the fuselage frame for each point (Figure 503). Table 501 - ALLOWABLE GAPS AND STEPS Allowable Gap (mm) Allowable Step (mm) Check Points Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum 1 and 2 1.0 5.0 -3.0 -1.0 9 to 12 1.0 5.0 -3.0 -1.0 3 to 8 1.0 5.0 Not Controlled NOTE: The door needs to be in a recess of 1.0 up to 3.0 mm. (6) If a point is out of specification, remove the door ( AMM TASK 52-44-01-000-801-A/ 400) and install shims under the guides to adjust the gaps and/or under the supports to adjust the steps. (7) Do steps (4) and (5) again until the gap and step values become permitted. NOTE: Make sure that it is not necessary to use too much force during the door locking and unlocking procedures. (8) Install the latch on the fuselage. (9) It is necessary that one person goes into the rear electronic compartment while the other person locks the door from outside. The person inside the rear electronic compartment will make sure that: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 820-801-A/500 52-44-01 Page 6 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) The four lock pins of the door butt against the outboard surface of their housing interior. (b) The center of the lock pin of the latch is at the center of the door support hole. If it does not occur, adjust the latch height with the shim under the latch. (10) Apply sealant PR-1440 B2 all around the shim and on the four bolt heads. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. NOTE: The sealant is applied only to one shim. Refer to Figure 502.
