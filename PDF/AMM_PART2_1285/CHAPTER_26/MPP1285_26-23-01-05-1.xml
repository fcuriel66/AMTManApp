Preparation SUBTASK 840-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the BAGGAGE FIRE EXTG circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (2) Put the ladder in the work area. (3) Open access door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) to get access to the electronic compartment. (4) Remove the baggage-compartment fire-extinguisher bottles ( AMM TASK 26-23-01-000-801-A/400). NOTE: Install a protective cap only on the cartridge located at the discharge outlet. It is not necessary to install protective caps on the other disconnected points. The weight check must be done without protective caps installed. J. Baggage-Compartment Fire-Extinguisher Bottles (High Rate and Metering) - Weight Check (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-003-A WARNING: INCORRECT HANDLING OF A CHARGED FIRE EXTINGUISHER BOTTLE CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE OF THE EXTINGUISHING AGENT AND POSSIBLE INJURY TO PERSONS. MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PROTECTION ON THE OUTLETS OF THE DISCHARGE TUBING BEFORE YOU MOVE THE BOTTLE. DO NOT HIT THE BOTTLE AGAINST AIRCRAFT PARTS AND PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE BOTTLE. DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE TO, OR INSERT ANYTHING INTO THE DISCHARGE OUTLET OR FILL FITTING. WARNING: IF THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER BOTTLE DISCHARGES, DO NOT BREATHE THE HALON GASES OR GET HALON ON YOUR SKIN OR IN YOUR EYES. MAKE SURE ALL PERSONNEL GO TO A SAFE AREA WITH A GOOD AIRFLOW. HALON GASES CAN CAUSE SKIN AND EYE IRRITATION. (1) Do the weight check of the baggage-compartment fire-extinguisher bottles, High-rate (1) and Metering (2). You can refer to the last revision of Pacific Scientific CMM 26-23-46 (for High-rate) and Pacific Scientific CMM 26-23-47 (for Metering), or do the steps that follow: (a) Put the cradle on the weighing scale. Adjust the weighing scale to zero. (b) Put the fire-extinguisher bottle on the cradle. (c) Weigh the fire extinguisher bottle. Adjust the accuracy of the weighing scale near 0.005 kg (0.01 lb). (d) Compare the current weight to the last weight recorded on the identification plate. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 720-801-A/500 26-23-01 Page 5 of 7 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
