			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them. • FIRE EXTG BTL A 1/2. • FIRE EXTG BTL B 1/2. (2) Open access door 312AR (AMM MPP 06-41-00/100) to get access to the tail cone compartment. WARNING: • WHEN YOU CONNECT OR DISCONNECT THE ELECTRIC CONNECTOR OF THE BOTTLE CARTRIDGE, OR WHEN YOU KEEP IT DISCONNECTED, YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE PINS OF ITS RECEPTACLE. • THE CARTRIDGE IS AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. ACCIDENTAL DETONATION OF A CARTRIDGE BY ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE CAN CAUSE INJURY. FOR SAFE HANDLING, DO NOT TOUCH THE CARTRIDGE CONNECTOR PINS AFTER YOU REMOVE THE PROTECTIVE CAP OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR. (3) Disconnect the electrical connectors (1) from the fire extinguishing bottle cartridges (2). Protect the receptacles with plastic caps. (4) Energize the aircraft with a DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (5) Set MFD 1 (or 2) to the ELEC page (AMM SDS 31-41-00/1): (a) Read the battery 1 voltage and record it as V (AMM SDS 24-36-00/1). 1 (b) Read the battery 2 voltage and record it as V (AMM SDS 24-36-00/1). 2 J. Functionally Check Engine Fire Extinguishing System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Do the check as follows: (a) Make sure that there is continuity to ground from pin A of the electrical connectors (1). (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below: • FIRE EXTG BTL A 1/2. • FIRE EXTG BTL B 1/2. (3) Examine the fire handle 1 as follows: (a) Pull fire handle 1 and turn it left. Result: 1 The voltage between pins A and B, and pins A and C of connector P0917 must be V ÃÂ± 0.5 V DC. 1 EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 26-21-00 Page 3 of 10 Rev 49 - Feb  16/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Result: 1 The voltage between pins A and B, and pins A and C of connector P0929 must be V ÃÂ± 0.5 V DC. 2 (6) Push fire handle 2 to put it back to the normal condition. (a) Make sure that there is a voltage of approximately 21.5 V DC between pins A and B, and A and C of electrical connectors P0918 and P0929. (7) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • FIRE EXTG BTL A 1/2. • FIRE EXTG BTL B 1/2. (8) Install a jumper between pins A and B of connectors P917, P918, P920, and P929. (9) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them: • FIRE EXTG BTL A 1/2. • FIRE EXTG BTL B 1/2. (10) On the EICAS display, the messages below go out of view: • E1 EXT BTLA INOP. • E2 EXT BTLA INOP. • E1 EXT BTLB INOP. • E2 EXT BTLB INOP. (11) Do a check on the EICAS messages as follows: (a) Open the jumper of connector P917. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 26-21-00 Page 4 of 10 Rev 49 - Feb  16/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
