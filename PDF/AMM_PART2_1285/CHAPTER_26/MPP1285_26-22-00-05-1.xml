(3) For EMB-145LR, EMB-145LU, and EMB-135LR/KL models: WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE LANDING GEAR SAFETY PINS ARE INSTALLED TO PREVENT INJURIES TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (a) Remove access panel 156EZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) to get access to the APU fuel-shutoff valve. (4) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breaker APU FIRE EXTG. WARNING: • WHEN YOU CONNECT OR DISCONNECT THE ELECTRIC CONNECTOR OF THE BOTTLE CARTRIDGE, OR WHEN YOU KEEP IT DISCONNECTED, YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE PINS OF ITS RECEPTACLE. • THE CARTRIDGE IS AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE . ACCIDENTAL DETONATION OF A CARTRIDGE BY ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE CAN CAUSE INJURY. FOR SAFE HANDLING, DO NOT TOUCH THE CARTRIDGE CONNECTOR PINS AFTER YOU REMOVE THE PROTECTIVE CAP OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR. (5) Disconnect the electrical connector (1) from the bottle cartridge (2). (6) Energize the aircraft with an External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). J. Functionally Check APU Fire-Extinguishing System (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Do a check for continuity to the ground from pin A of the electrical connector (1). (a) Set the APU master switch to the "ON" position. 1 The mechanical position indicator of the APU fuel shutoff valve goes to the "OPEN" position.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRIC CONNECTOR OF THE EXTINGUISHING BOTTLE CARTRIDGE IS DISCONNECTED. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the APU FIRE EXTG circuit breaker. (a) Push the APU fire-extinguishing switch and keep it pushed. 1 The mechanical position indicator of the APU fuel shutoff valve goes to the "CLOSE" position. 2 Make sure that there is 28 V DC between pins A and B and pins A and C of the connector (1). (b) Release the APU fire extinguishing switch. 1 Make sure that there is approximately 21.5 V DC between pins A and B and pins A and C of the connector (1). (3) Set the APU master switch to the OFF position. (4) On the circuit breaker panel, open the APU FIRE EXTG circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (5) Install a jumper between pins A and B of the electrical connector (1). (6) On the circuit breaker panel, close the APU FIRE EXTG circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (7) On the EICAS display, the APU EXTBTL INOP message goes out of view. (8) Do a check on the EICAS messages as follows: (a) Open the jumper of the connector (1). Result: 1 The message APU EXTBTL INOP comes into view on the EICAS display. (b) Close the jumper of the connector (1). Result: 1 The message APU EXTBTL INOP goes out of view on the EICAS display. (c) On the circuit breaker panel, open the APU FIRE EXTG circuit breaker. Result: 1 The message APU EXTBTL INOP comes into view on the EICAS display. (d) On the circuit breaker panel, close the APU FIRE EXTG circuit breaker. Result: 1 The message APU EXTBTL INOP goes out of view on the EICAS display. (9) For aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-26-0007 with EICAS versions up to 17: (a) Disconnect the P922 electrical connector from the bottle pressure gauge and switch (3). Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the APU EXTBTL INOP message. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 26-22-00 Page 4 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Connect the P922 electrical connector to the bottle pressure gauge and switch (3). NOTE: Make sure that the connector colored identification and inscription match those of the ring sticker applied around the pressure gauge and switch. Result: 1 The EICAS message goes out of view. (10) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-26-0007 with EICAS versions up to 17 or with EICAS versions 18 and on: (a) Disconnect the P922 connector from the pressure gauge and switch (3). (b) Install a jumper between pins A and C of the P922 electrical connector. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the message APU EXTBTL INOP. (c) Remove the jumper from between pins A and C of the P922 electrical connector. Result: 1 The EICAS message goes out of view.
