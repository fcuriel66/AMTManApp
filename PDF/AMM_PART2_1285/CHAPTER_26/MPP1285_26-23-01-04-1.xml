			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: • THE CARTRIDGE IS AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. ACCIDENTAL DETONATION OF A CARTRIDGE BY ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE CAN CAUSE INJURY. FOR SAFE HANDLING, DO NOT TOUCH THE CARTRIDGE CONNECTOR PINS AFTER YOU REMOVE THE PROTECTIVE CAP OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR. • WHEN YOU CONNECT OR DISCONNECT THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR OF THE BOTTLE CARTRIDGE, OR WHEN YOU KEEP IT DISCONNECTED, YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE PINS OF ITS ELECTRICAL RECEPTACLE. • DO NOT LET TOOLS OR DEVICES THAT CAN CAUSE VOLTAGE SPARKS OR ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES TOUCH THE PINS OF THE ELECTRICAL RECEPTACLE. (1) Disconnect the electrical connectors (1) from the baggage-compartment fire- extinguisher High-Rate bottle (2) and Metering bottle (3). (2) Disconnect the discharge piping (4) of the baggage compartment fire-extinguisher High-Rate bottle (2), from the two-way check tee valve (ref.) and from the Metering bottle (3). (3) Install protection caps to the disconnected points. (4) Remove the bolts (5) and washers (6) from the baggage High Rate bottle brackets (7), and remove the High Rate bottle (2). (5) Remove the bolts (8) and washers (9) from the baggage Metering bottle brackets (10), and remove the Metering bottle (3).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: • THE CARTRIDGE IS AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. ACCIDENTAL DETONATION OF A CARTRIDGE BY ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE CAN CAUSE INJURY. FOR SAFE HANDLING, DO NOT TOUCH THE CARTRIDGE CONNECTOR PINS AFTER YOU REMOVE THE PROTECTIVE CAP OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR. • DO NOT MOVE THE BOTTLES WITH THE OUTLETS OF THE DISCHARGE TUBING WITHOUT PROTECTION. DO NOT HIT THE BOTTLE AGAINST AIRCRAFT PARTS. PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE BOTTLE BECAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE CAN CAUSE INJURIES. CAUTION: IF THE ELECTRICAL BONDING DEVICE DOES NOT MAKE UP A GOOD ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVE PATH, DAMAGE CAN OCCUR TO THE AIRCRAFT OR THE EQUIPMENT. (1) Refer to AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200 for the electrical bonding procedures and install the High Rate bottle (2) with bolts (5) and washers (6). NOTE: Use a torque wrench to torque the bolts to 7.9 − 10.2 N.m (70 − 90 lb.in). (2) Refer to AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200 for the electrical bonding procedures and install the Metering bottle (3) with bolts (8) and washers (9). NOTE: Use a torque wrench to torque the bolts to 7.9 − 10.2 N.m (70 − 90 lb.in). (3) Remove the protection caps from the disconnected points. CAUTION: DO NOT TRANSMIT THE AIRCRAFT TUBE WEIGHT OR STRAIN TO THE VALVE. ALIGN BEFORE YOU CONNECT THEM. (4) Connect the discharge piping (4) to the baggage High Rate bottle (2) and Metering bottle (3) discharge heads. NOTE: If the discharge outlet of the bottles is not aligned with the pipe, loosen the swivel nut of discharge outlet, align the discharge outlet with the aircraft pipe, and use a torque wrench to torque the discharge outlet swivel nut to 61 - 75 N.m (540 - 663.8 lb.in / 45 - 55 lb.ft). Install safety wire on swivel nut of discharge outlet (TASK 20-10-02-200-801-A). CAUTION: USE TWO TORQUE WRENCHES WHEN YOU CONNECT TUBES. USE ONE WRENCH TO HOLD THE NIPPLE AND THE OTHER WRENCH TO TURN THE TUBE COUPLING NUT. THIS PRECAUTION WILL PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE TUBES. (5) Use a torque wrench to torque the discharge pipe nuts to 37.3 - 40.7 N.m (330 - 360 lb.in). CAUTION: BEFORE YOU CONNECT THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS, MAKE SURE THAT THE "BAGGAGE FIRE EXTG" CIRCUIT BREAKER IS OPEN. (6) Connect the electrical connectors (1) to the baggage High Rate bottle (2) and Metering bottle (3).
