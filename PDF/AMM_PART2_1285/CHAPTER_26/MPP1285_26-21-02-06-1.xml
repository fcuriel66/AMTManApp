			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them. • FIRE EXTG BTL A 1/2. • FIRE EXTG BTL B 1/2. (2) Put the ladder in the work area. (3) Remove the engine fire extinguishing bottle (AMM TASK 26-21-02-000-801-A/400). J. Engine Fire Extinguishing Bottle - Weight and Pressure Check (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 280-002-A WARNING: INCORRECT HANDLING OF A CHARGED FIRE EXTINGUISHER BOTTLE CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE OF THE EXTINGUISHING AGENT AND POSSIBLE INJURY TO PERSONS. MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PROTECTION ON THE OUTLETS OF THE DISCHARGE TUBING BEFORE YOU MOVE THE BOTTLE. DO NOT HIT THE BOTTLE AGAINST AIRCRAFT PARTS AND PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE BOTTLE. DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE TO, OR INSERT ANYTHING INTO THE DISCHARGE OUTLET OR FILL FITTING. WARNING: IF THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER BOTTLE DISCHARGES, DO NOT BREATHE THE HALON GASES OR GET HALON ON YOUR SKIN OR IN YOUR EYES. MAKE SURE ALL PERSONNEL GO TO A SAFE AREA WITH A GOOD AIRFLOW. HALON GASES CAN CAUSE SKIN AND EYE IRRITATION. (1) Do the weighing of the engine fire extinguisher bottle (1). You can refer to the latest revision as given in Pacific Scientific CMM 26-20-202 and supplement 33600057, or do the steps that follow: (a) Put a cradle on the Weighing Scale. Adjust the weighing scale to zero. NOTE: You can use equivalent materials for these items. (b) Remove all protective caps on the unit and put the unit on the scale. (c) Weigh the unit. Adjust the accuracy of the weighing scale to nearest 0.005 kg (0.01 lb). NOTE: • The weight marked on the identification plate (2) does not include the protective caps. (d) Compare the current weight of the engine fire extinguishing bottle (1) to the last weight etched on the identification plate (2). If the engine fire extinguishing bottle weight is more than 0.05 kg (0.10 lb) below or above the last recorded weight, replace the engine fire extinguishing bottle (1). (e) Install the protective caps. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 26-21-02 Page 3 of 5 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>
