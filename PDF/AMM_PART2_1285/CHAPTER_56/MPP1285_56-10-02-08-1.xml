			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE SOLVENT GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (2) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the surface. (3) Measure the necessary length of the rubber trim as follows: hold the tape against the surface where you will apply it, or use a tape measure. The length where the larger rib will be applied is critical. The other lengths of the seal tape can be slightly stretched or compressed, but the cut length of the large rib must be the same as the length to be installed. Cut the rubber trim 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch longer as a precaution. NOTE: • Trim the rubber trim at the corners at a 30-degree angles. • Do not trim the large rib shorter than the sealing surface. (4) Align the larger rib with the edge of the sealing area while you bond the rubber trim after the removal of the adhesive release paper (Figure 801 - 2) and (Figure 801 - 3). NOTE: If you apply more pressure to the seal you will cause the pressure sensitive adhesive to attach more securely to the sealing surface. Also there will be an indentation/discoloration at the fastener holes, which will make their identification easier. (5) With a nonmetallic object with a sharp point, start all fastener holes. Flat tipped fasteners will not go through the seal unless the hole is started before (Figure 801 - 4). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the windshield ( AMM TASK 56-10-01-400-802-A/400).
