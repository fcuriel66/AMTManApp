Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A EFFECTIVITY: FLAT SECTION SEAL (1) There are two different conditions for the installation of the cockpit emergency-exit rubber trim seal. (a) Installation of the same cockpit emergency-exit rubber trim seal. Do steps (2) to (15). (b) Installation of a new cockpit emergency-exit rubber trim seal. Do steps (3) to (15). (2) Remove the sealant from the cockpit emergency-exit rubber trim seal. (3) Mask off all the acrylic surface. (4) On the upper, lower, and back sides of the cockpit emergency exit, apply a 5 mm (0,20 in) wide tape to the cockpit emergency exit edge as a protection for the part that will not receive the sealant (Figure 401); Sheet 2). (5) Sand the parts of the cockpit emergency exit to which sealant RTV-157 (Figure 401); Sheet 2) will be applied, the cockpit emergency exit front side included. (6) Apply a thin coat of sealant RTV 157 to the area to which the rubber trim seal will be attached (Figure 401); Sheet 2). NOTE: If necessary, use the acrylic spatula to apply the sealant. (7) Install the rubber trim seal all around the cockpit emergency exit, with the free (unbounded) edge outboard on the upper, lower, and back sides of the cockpit emergency exit (Figure 401); Sheet 2). NOTE: • Make sure that the end of the rubber trim seal is aligned with the cockpit emergency exit edge.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Clean the excess sealant. (8) Remove the adhesive tape from the cockpit emergency exit (Figure 401); Sheet 2). (9) On the front side of the cockpit emergency exit, make sure that the flange of the rubber trim seal is bonded to the cockpit emergency exit with sealant RTV 157 (Figure 401); SECTION C-C). NOTE: • Attach the flange of the rubber trim seal only on the front side of the cockpit emergency exit. • To prevent free edges in the front part of the cockpit emergency exit, push on the rubber trim seal until it is fully attached to the cockpit emergency exit. Use tape if necessary. (10) Apply sealant RTV157 between the rubber back end and the cockpit emergency exit (Figure 401); Sheet 1). NOTE: Wet the finger in a water-detergent solution and mold the sealant around the rubber. (11) When the sealant is cured, the aircraft can be dispatched. NOTE: The sealant curing time changes with the environmental conditions. Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR. (12) Cut off the excess sealant edges. (13) Install the cockpit emergency exit (AMM TASK 56-11-01-400-801-A/400). (14) Do a check for water penetration through the cockpit emergency exit. (a) If there is no water penetration, do step (15). (b) If there is water penetration: 1 Align the cockpit emergency exit ( AMM TASK 56-11-00-820-801-A/500). 2 Do other check for water penetration through the cockpit emergency exit. If the water penetration continues, do step (15). (15) Pressurize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 21-31-00-860-801-A/200). (16) Make sure that there is no air leakage through the cockpit emergency exit. If there is, replace the fuselage frame sealant, according to the instructions below. (17) Depressurize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 21-31-00-860-802-A/200). (18) Replace the fuselage frame sealant as follows: (a) Remove the cockpit emergency exit (AMM TASK 56-11-01-000-801-A/400). (b) To remove the fuselage frame sealant, do as follows: 1 Pull the sealant from the fuselage frame.
