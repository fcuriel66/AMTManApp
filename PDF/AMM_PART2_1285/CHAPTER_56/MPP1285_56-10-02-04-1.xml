			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Install the rubber trim with its splined side pointed to the aircraft structure. (2) For aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-56-0006 do as follows: WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE SOLVENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE SOLVENT GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (a) With a cloth moist with Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone (Spec. ASTM-D-740), clean the area where the new windshield frame seal will be bonded. (b) Measure the necessary length of the new seal as follows: hold the tape against the surface where you will apply it, or use a tape measure. The length where the larger rib will be applied is critical. The other lengths of the seal tape can be slightly stretched or compressed, but the cut length of the larger rib must be the same as the length to be installed. It can be useful to cut the seal 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch longer as precaution. (c) Trim rubber trim P/N GSC-2180767-00 at the corners at a 30-degree angle. NOTE: Do not trim the large rib shorter than the sealing surface. (d) Bond the rubber trim as follows: remove the adhesive release paper and put the larger rib all along the contour of the cockpit windshield frame. Make sure that there is a minimum outboard edge margin of 5.0 mm and a minimum distance of 3.5 mm from the windshield center post center line to the seal edge. Only after the larger rib is in the correct position, you must push the rubber trim firmly against the sealing surface. NOTE: • Make the external bulb of the rubber trim fill the chamfer of the cockpit windshield molding. • After the cockpit windshield frame is installed with the rubber trim, no curing time is necessary. (e) Do the rubber trim measuring and trimming procedure on the adjacent edges. NOTE: • To keep the rubber trim integrity, there must be an overlap of one- quarter to one-half inch at the adjacent ends of a splice on a corner or part of a repair. • Around curved areas, also correctly put the larger rib in position before you push the rest of the rubber trim against the aircraft structure. It is important not to let wrinkles be pinched together and folded over to make three layers of tape. This can cause uneven sealing. Wrinkles must be cut and overlapped as in the alternate cornering , or they must be smoothed out by hand, if they are small. • If you apply more pressure to the seal you will cause the pressure sensitive adhesive to attach more tightly to the sealing surface. Also there will be an indentation/discoloration at the fastener holes, which will make their identification easier.
