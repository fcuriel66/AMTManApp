Preparation SUBTASK 841-004-A (1) Put the workstand in position and get access to the cockpit windshield from the outside. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL NOT TO SCRATCH THE WINDSHIELD TRANSPARENCY. (2) Clean the windshield surface ( AMM TASK 56-10-01-100-801-A/700). J. Check and Adjustment of the Cockpit Windshield External Static Charge (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 720-004-A EFFECTIVITY: AIRCRAFT WITH SIERRACIN-MADE WINDSHIELD (1) Use a multimeter to do an inspection of the windshield for anti-static drain coating, as follows: (2) Attach one probe to the frame of the windshield. CAUTION: • LIGHT HAND PRESSURE ON THE PROBES IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ELECTRICAL CONTACT WHEN YOU MAKE THE MEASUREMENT. • FOR WINDSHIELDS WITH PYROLYTIC COATING, A SLIGHTLY STRONGER HAND PRESSURE IS NEEDED TO HAVE ELECTRICAL CONTACT. • BE CAREFUL NOT TO SCRATCH THE WINDSHIELD DURING THIS TEST. (3) Make the tip of the other probe touch the face ply of the windshield. CAUTION: • BE CAREFUL NOT TO SCRATCH THE GLASS FACEPLY WHEN IT IS SCANNED FOR ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY. • DO NOT TRY TO REMOVE THE SCRATCHES OR STREAKS FROM THE GLASS SURFACES WITH A POLISHING PROCEDURE. POLISHING CAN REMOVE THE ANTI-STATIC COAT AND CAUSE OPTICAL DISTORTIONS. (4) Scan all the area above the heater coating and make sure that there is continuity between the two probe tips. NOTE: • No resistance value is specified. This is only a continuity check and any resistance readable will be satisfactory.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • The anti-corrosion finish on the frame, surface contaminants on the windshield, and other factors can affect the resistance measurement, but they do not affect the function of the part. • The resistance measurement can be made at the screws or with two probe tips put on the glass surface. (5) Do step (4) again and again while you move the probe tips to different locations across the surface of the windshield and the adjacent frame. If there is not continuity, go to step (6). NOTE: • It is not necessary to make readings in the unheated areas of the windshield. • Continuity readings at any point on the part are indication of a satisfactory windshield. • If the two windshields on the same aircraft fail to meet test requirements in actions (2) to (5), then at least one must be removed from service after detection and replaced. • If only one windshield on an aircraft fails to meet test requirements in actions (2) to (5), then it must be removed from service after detection and replaced. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE A MEGOHMMETER. THE AIRCRAFT MUST BE PROPERLY GROUNDED. WARN PERSONNEL OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT NOT TO TOUCH THE FUSELAGE. ELECTRICAL SHOCK CAN OCCUR. (6) Do the steps (2) to (5) again, with a megohmmeter set at 1000 V DC. K. Check and Adjustment of the Cockpit Windshield External Static Charge (Figure 506)  SUBTASK 720-004-B EFFECTIVITY: AIRCRAFT WITH PPG-MADE WINDSHIELD WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE A MEGOHMMETER. THE AIRCRAFT MUST BE PROPERLY GROUNDED. WARN PERSONNEL OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT NOT TO TOUCH THE FUSELAGE. ELECTRICAL SHOCK CAN OCCUR. CAUTION: • LIGHT HAND PRESSURE ON THE PROBES IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ELECTRICAL CONTACT WHEN YOU MAKE THE MEASUREMENT. • FOR WINDSHIELDS WITH PYROLYTIC COATING, A SLIGHTLY STRONGER HAND PRESSURE IS NEEDED TO HAVE ELECTRICAL CONTACT. • BE CAREFUL NOT TO SCRATCH THE WINDSHIELD DURING THIS TEST. (1) Use a standard ohmmeter to check the anti-static coating resistance from the outer glass surface to the ground terminal.
