			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 56-11-01-200-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. COCKPIT EMERGENCY EXIT - INSPECTION/CHECK A. General (1) You can find these types of damage in the cockpit emergency exit. (a) Delamination: 1. It is the condition which occurs when there is a separation of the interlayer from the acrylic mainplies. 2. Moisture or solvent that goes into the interlayer becomes cloudy or milky. This occurs when the peripheral edge seal is damaged. (b) Crazing: 1. It is a large quantity of very fine cracks in the matrix material. (c) Cracks: 1. It is a physical separation of two adjacent portions of material, as shown by a fine or thin line across the surface. (d) Chips: 1. Minor damage to a protruded surface where material is removed without a crack or craze. (e) Scratches or Abrasions: 1. Small tear or break in the surface after foreign material lightly and momentarily touches or rubs the surface. (f) Bubbles, Colored Spots, and similar defects: 1. A defect in the film in which there are bubbles of air, solvent vapor, or latent defects in the material. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL D. Auxiliary Items ITEM DESCRIPTION PURPOSE QTY Commercially To get access to the cockpit emergency exit Workstand  available from the outside E. Consumable Materials Not Applicable F. Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Outside and inside the cockpit H. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Put the workstand in position and get access to the cockpit emergency exit from the outside. I. Inspection/Check (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 212-002-A CAUTION: EMBRAER RECOMMENDS THAT THE TRANSPARENCY BE REMOVED FROM THE AIRCRAFT TO REPAIR SCRATCHES OR ABRASIONS. FOR REMOVAL OF THE TRANSPARENCY FROM THE AIRCRAFT FOR REPAIR, REFER TO THE LAST REVISION OF THE SIERRACIN COMPONENT MAINTENANCE MANUAL - CMM 56-10-03 PART NÃÂº 163600. (1) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for delaminations: (a) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit mainply-to-mainply vinyl interlayer for delamination. Result: 1 Delaminations are permitted in the non-optical area only. Non-optical area is a 50.8 mm (2 in) peripheral area that you measure from the perimeter of the optical viewing area (window/frame intersection). Replace the side panel with a serviceable unit, if delaminations are in a larger area. (2) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for crazing: (a) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit mainplies for crazing. Result: 1 Crazing is not permitted. Replace the side panel with a serviceable unit. (3) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for cracks: (a) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit mainplies for cracks.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 Cracks in the mainplies are not permitted. Replace the side panel with a serviceable unit. NOTE: Make sure that they are cracks in fact and not edge chips or splits/ cracks in the interlayer or interlayer delamination. (4) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for chips: NOTE: When a repair is necessary in the steps that follow, refer to the transparency manufacturer's CMM. (a) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency-exit mainplies for chips. Result: 1 Surface defects are not permitted. Replace the side panel with a serviceable unit. 2 Edge defects are permitted if they do not have more than 3.05 mm (0.12 in) from the edge. (Measure from the edge of the window, inward). Replace the side panel with a serviceable unit only if the damage size is larger than 3.05 mm (0.12 in) from the edge. (5) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for scratches or abrasions: (a) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for light scratches or cloudy appearance. Result: 1 It is not necessary to correct these conditions immediately if the pilot's visibility is not decreased. You can repair them during scheduled maintenance service. (b) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for minor scratches. Result: 1 These are scratches less than 0.254 mm (0.01 in) deep. It is not necessary to repair them immediately if the pilot's visibility is not decreased. You can repair them during scheduled maintenance service. (c) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for major scratches. Result: 1 These are scratches more than 0.254 mm (0.01 in) deep. You must replace or repair the side panel. (6) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit for bubbles, colored spots, and similar defects: (a) Do an inspection on the cockpit emergency exit mainplies for bubbles, colored spots, and similar defects. Result: 1 These defects are permitted if their size, quantity, and pattern do not decrease pilot's visibility. Replace the side panel with a serviceable unit only if the defects decrease pilot's visibility.
