			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the alignment Emergency exits I. Alignment (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  (Figure 504)  (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 820-002-A (1) With the emergency exit fully closed (control lever in the locked position), make sure that it is aligned with the fuselage loft line. NOTE: The lever will be in the locked position when the signal flag is out of view. (2) If it is not aligned, adjust the eccentric bushing until it is in line with the fuselage loft line. Refer to Figure 502; DET. A; DET. B; and DET. C. NOTE: There must be a minimum gap of 0.5 mm and a maximum gap of 1.5 mm between the Teflon guide upper surface and the airplane structure, when the emergency exit is locked in the closed position (Figure 503). If the gap is not in the limits specified, replace the Teflon bushing and file it down to get the correct gap. (3) After the alignment, move the control grip. If there is seizing or friction, adjust the eccentric bushing until a smooth movement is got when the control lever (rear lower bellcrank is not locked) is moved. Refer to Figure 502; DET. D. (4) Measure the necessary force to operate the cockpit emergency exit (Figure 505). NOTE: • To open the cockpit emergency exit, the lock button on the control grip must be pushed. Refer to AMM SDS 56-10-00/1. • Make sure that the dynamometer is perpendicular to the internal handle all along the handle travel. • Make sure that handle do not spin during test. – To open the cockpit emergency exit, the reference force is 157 N (16 kgf) and not greater than 176.5 N (18 kgf). – To close the cockpit emergency exit, the reference force is 245 N (25 kgf) and not greater than 353 N (36 kgf). – If the values are not satisfactory, go to step (2). (5) Do a check for water penetration through the cockpit emergency exit. (a) If there is no water penetration, go to step (6). (b) If there is water penetration, replace ( AMM TASK 56-11-02-400-801-A/400) or rework ( AMM TASK 56-11-03-300-801-A/800) the cockpit emergency-exit rubber-trim seal or, on aircraft PRE-MOD S.B.145-56-0004, the fuselage frame sealant. (6) Apply the final torque to the eccentric shaft nuts. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 820-801-A/500 56-11-00 Page 5 of 12 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
