USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (d) Clean all surfaces to be bonded with MEK. (e) Cut a rubber trim seal piece to the same size as the old (removed) rubber trim seal piece. (f) Apply sealant RTV-157 to the new rubber trim seal surfaces to be bonded (Figure 801 or Figure 802; DET. C, as applicable). Refer to SRM 51-20-01-PR for the curing time.

(h) Use an acrylic spatula to remove the excess sealant (Figure 801 or Figure 802; DET. D, as applicable). NOTE: For a better finish of the sealant, wet your fingers in a water-detergent solution and mold the sealant on the rubber trim seal. (i) Make the repaired section stronger with sealant RTV-157 and a layer of Terylene cloth of approximately 20 mm (0.8 in) in width, on each side, away from the edges of the damaged area (Figure 801; DET. E). NOTE: The surface of the Terylene cloth that you must bond to the repaired area is the silicon rubber-impregnated surface. (j) When the sealant is cured, the aircraft can be dispatched.

USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. (a) Clean the repair area with MEK. Wait until the surface becomes dry. (b) Apply grease DC-4 (Dow Corning Lubricant) to the cockpit emergency exit frame seal, in the region to be repaired. (c) This repair is only temporary and must be permanently repaired before the aircraft completes 500 FC. M. Cockpit Emergency Exit Frame Seal Strip - Repair (Figure 804)  SUBTASK 350-005-A EFFECTIVITY: WITH STRIP (1) To repair the emergency exit frame seal strip, do as follows: (a) Cut the damaged area of the of the seal strip at 90 degrees and remove the damaged seal strip.
