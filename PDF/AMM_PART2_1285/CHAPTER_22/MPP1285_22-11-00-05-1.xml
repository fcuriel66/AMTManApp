Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Cockpit 1 Operates the test sets Outside the aircraft I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-006-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Make sure that the SENSORS (PITOT1/TAT1/AOA1, PITOT3 and PITOT2/TAT2/ AOA2) pushbuttons, on the Ice Protection control panel (overhead panel), are set to OFF. Attach DO-NOT-TURN-AUTO tags to them. (3) Make sure the SENSORS HTG circuit breaker is closed, on the circuit breaker panel. NOTE: If this circuit breaker is open, the heating of the pitot tubes and static ports will be activated. WARNING:DO NOT TOUCH THE PITOT, PITOT/STATIC SENSORS, AND ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE HEATER WAS SET TO OFF TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS. CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY PRESSURE TO THE PITOT TUBES WHEN THE STATIC PORTS ARE WITHOUT PRESSURE. THIS COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE MADC. (4) Remove the protection cover from the pitot and pitot/static sensors. (5) Connect the pitot/static system test set (GSE 129) to the aircraft ( AMM TASK 34-13-00-400-801-A/400). NOTE: This procedure can cause interference with the local air traffic during simulations of altitude with the anemometric bench test. To prevent this, make sure that the transponder is on the STANDBY condition (AMM SDS 34-52-00/1). (6) Energize the aircraft with the external DC power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). NOTE: After the energization of the aircraft with AHRS (AH-800), let three minutes go by for the AHRS stabilization. (7) Make sure that the systems below are serviceable and on: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-805-A/500 22-11-00 Page 51 of 54 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
