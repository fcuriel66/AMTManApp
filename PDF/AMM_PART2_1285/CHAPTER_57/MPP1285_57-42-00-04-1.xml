			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Install the screws (2) (148 positions) and tighten them in an each-second sequence to attach leading edge II (7). Refer to Figure 402. (3) Connect the end of the piccolo tube of leading edge II (7) to the end of the piccolo tube of leading edge III (4) as follows: CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU MOVE THE COUPLING (3) ON THE PICCOLO TUBE TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE SEAL DEVICE IN THE COUPLING AND TO THE PICCOLO TUBE ENDS. (a) Push the coupling (3) and connect it to the piccolo tube of leading edge III (4). NOTE: Make sure that the guide pin of the piccolo tube is correctly engaged on the slot of the coupling (3) (refer to DET. D). (b) Tighten the clamp of the coupling (3). (4) Connect the end of the piccolo tube of leading edge II (7) to the end of the piccolo tube of leading edge I (10) as follows: CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU MOVE THE COUPLING (1) ON THE PICCOLO TUBE TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE SEAL DEVICE IN THE COUPLING AND TO THE PICCOLO TUBE ENDS. (a) Push the coupling (1) and connect it to the piccolo tube of leading edge II (7). NOTE: Make sure that the guide pin of the piccolo tube is correctly engaged on the slot of the coupling (1) (refer to DET. D). (b) Tighten the clamp of the coupling (1). (5) Install the gaskets seal (11) in the region of the splices (6) and (9). WARNING: COR-BAN 27L CORROSION-INHIBITING COMPOUNDS ARE TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. USE GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE GLOVES. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. OBEY THE MANUFACTURES' HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. (6) Apply COR-BAN 27L to the screws (5) (52 positions) and (8) (64 positions) of the splice. (7) Install the splices (6) and (9) with the screws (5) and (8). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing along the gaps between the leading edge and the wing (refer to DET. B). Use the applicable procedure as necessary. (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. NOTE: The sealant curing time will change with the environmental conditions (SRM 51-20-01).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Acceleration of sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: Sealant curing time versus temperature rate changes as shown in the Sealant Specification Table (SRM 51-20-01). (c) Application of aluminum tape after tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as written in paragraph (b). 3 After the sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 150 hours. (d) Application of polyethylene film and aluminum tape. 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. 2 Apply a polyethylene film on the sealant. 3 Apply the aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape is applied. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 10 days. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU APPLY SEALANT ALONG THE CONTOUR OF THE SPLICES (6) AND (9) TO PREVENT BLOCKAGE OF THEIR DRAIN HOLES. (2) Apply aerodynamic sealant RTV 157 (SRM 51-20-01) along the gaps between the splice (6) and (9) and the leading edges (refer to DET. C). (3) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the WING circuit breaker and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (4) Do an operational check of the Wing Thermal Anti-Icing System ( AMM TASK 30-00-00-700-802-A/500).
