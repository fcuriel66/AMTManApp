			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Make sure that the slot of the coupling (3) is correctly engaged on the guide pin of the piccolo tube. Refer to (Figure 401); DET. D. (b) Tighten the clamp of the coupling (3). (9) Install the gasket in the region of the splice. WARNING:COR-BAN 27L IS TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY INHALATION.

Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) There are different methods to do the aerodynamic sealing along the gaps between the leading edge and wing and between the leading edge and the wing-to-fuselage fairing. Refer to (Figure 401); DET. B). Use the applicable procedure as necessary. (a) Full sealant-curing time: 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. NOTE: The sealant curing time will change with the environmental conditions (SRM 51-20-01). (b) Acceleration of sealant curing time with heating: 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. 2 Wait for one hour after the sealant is applied. CAUTION: THE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). 3 Heat the area which received the sealant. NOTE: Sealant curing time versus temperature rate changes as shown in the Sealant Specification Table (SRM 51-20-01). (c) Application of aluminum tape after tack-free time. NOTE: This procedure must only be done when a faster aircraft clearance is necessary. 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. 2 You can accelerate the sealant curing time as written in paragraph (b). 3 After the sealant is tack-free, apply aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape is applied. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 57-41-00 Page 9 of 10 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 150 hours. (d) Application of polyethylene film and aluminum tape. 1 Apply sealant PR 2050 B-1/2. 2 Apply a polyethylene film on the sealant. 3 Apply the aluminum tape. NOTE: You can operate the aircraft immediately after the aluminum tape application. 4 Remove the aluminum tape after 10 days. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU APPLY SEALANT ALONG THE CONTOUR OF THE FAIRING (6) TO PREVENT BLOCKAGE OF ITS DRAIN HOLE. (2) Apply aerodynamic sealant RTV 157 along the gaps between the splice (6) and the leading edges. Refer to (Figure 401); DET. E. (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the WING circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from it. (4) Do an operational test of the wing thermal anti-icing system ( AMM TASK 30-00-00-700-802-A/500). (5) Install access panels 191EL and 191FR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100).
