			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WING-TO-STUB ATTACHMENT BOLTS - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to remove and install the Wing-To-Stub Attachment Bolts. B. The procedures to removal and installation must be applied one bolt at a time in each half-wing. NOTE: • The next bolt in each half-wing only must be removed if the previous bolt is installed. • The removal and installation could be done in any sequence, since that the bolt removed in the (LH) and the (RH) half-wing stub be in the same position. • It is not necessary to wait for sealant cure time and final torque in order to start with the next bolt removal. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Install the bolt, washers, and nut. NOTE: Install the assembly in the same position as it was when it was removed. (2) Refer to Table 402 and apply tightening torque to the nut or bolt: NOTE: • The tightening torque values are different for the nuts to which the torque is applied with the aid of adapters. For these bolts, the Table 403 must be used. • Do not remove the excess sealant from the edges of the washers. (3) Refer to Table 402 and apply final tightening torque to the nut or bolt from 6 to 12 hours after the sealant was applied. NOTE: • It is not necessary to wait for sealant cure time and final torque in order to start with the next bolt removal. • The final tightening torque values are different for the nuts to which the torque is applied with the aid of adapters. For these bolts, the Table 403 must be used.
