			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation (Figure 701)  SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: • USE INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT DURING ALL WORKSTEPS OF THIS PROCESS. • BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE CHEMICAL MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. • CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE. THE WORK MUST BE DONE IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. CAUTION: • DO NOT POUR CLEANING PRODUCT DIRECTLY ON THE LENS SURFACE. • DO NOT ALLOW THE CLEANING PRODUCT TO EVAPORATE FROM THE LENS SURFACE. DRY IT WITH A LINT-FREE CLOTH. • BE SURE NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY SCRATCH THE LENS WITH WATCHES, BRACELETS, RINGS, AND TOOLS. SCRATCHES CAN CAUSE OPTICAL DISTORTIONS. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Remove the wing tip ( AMM TASK 57-30-00-000-801-A/400). (3) Remove the wing tip lens AMM TASK 57-30-01-000-801-A/400. (4) Prepare a detergent solution with neutral detergent (MEP 21-012) diluted 10% in volume of water. Prepare a cleaning solution with isopropylic alcohol diluted 50% in volume of water). (5) Wash the wing tip lens with flush water and neutral detergent to clean all dirt, debris and foreign matters. Clean the exterior surface of the wing tip lens carefully. Use a Wypall wiper moist with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water. J. Sanding SUBTASK 120-002-A CAUTION: • DURING ALL SANDING OPERATIONS, KEEP THE EXTERIOR SURFACE OF THE WING TIP LENS WET TO PREVENT HEAT DISTORTION AND MATERIAL BUILDUP ON SANDPAPER. • DO NOT APPLY UNDUE PRESSURE TO THE SANDING PAD. (1) Wipe the lens clean in order to remove any dirt or particles. (2) Perform a Detailed Visual inspection at wing tip lens for cracks and obvious damages, verify all area at wing tip lens edge for crazing multiples cracks) at fastener holes, If found any crack or crazing areas at lens replace the part. (3) Measure the lens thickness near the scratched area with an ultrasonic gauge. Compare the actual remaining thickness with original thickness per Table 701.

If the thickness values is out of limits per Table 701, please contact Embraer Technical Support for further instructions. (5) Evaluate the damaged area, check visually the depth of scratches and select the initial abrasive grit from the Table 702.

(7) For the "3M" method, sand with the aid of a random orbital sander. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 100-801-A/700 57-30-01 Page 5 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (8) Sand with the first grit until the existing damage is removed. Always keep the exterior surface of the part wet and change the paper frequently to prevent acrylic buildup on the paper. (9) With the next higher grit-number paper (finer grit), sand the part until all of the scratches from the previous grit are removed. If you do the sanding by hand, sand 90 degrees to the last grit (cross pattern). (10) Continue sanding with consecutively higher grits until the finest abrasive grit is used. NOTE: Periodically measure the lens thickness in order to check if the final lens thickness has not been reached per Table 701. (11) When the existing damage is completely removed from lens surface, stop the sanding procedure and prepare to polishment. (12) Wash the wing tip lens with flush water and neutral detergent to clean all dirt, debris and foreign matters. Clean the exterior and interior surfaces of the wing tip lens carefully. Use a Wypall wiper moist with a mixture of isopropylic alcohol and water. (13) Measure the lens thickness near the scratched area with an ultrasonic gauge. Compare the actual remaining thickness with original thickness per Table 701. (14) If the Lens thickness is within allowable limits as indicated in Table 701, follow with polishing procedures. If the thickness values is out of limits per Table 701, please, stop the procedures and contact Embraer Technical Support for further instructions. K. Polishing (Figure 701)  SUBTASK 120-003-A WARNING: • USE INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT DURING ALL OPERATIONS OF THIS PROCESS. • BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE CHEMICAL MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY ARE A HEALTH AND FIRE HAZARD. USE SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING WHEN YOU HANDLE THEM. DO NOT BREATHE THEIR GASES AND WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA. CAUTION: • DO NOT DO THIS PROCEDURE UNDER SUNSHINE OR ON HEATED SURFACE. • PREVENT THE CONTACT OF THE MATERIAL WITH PLASTIC SURFACES OR RUBBER. USE CLEANING CLOTH MOIST WITH ISOPROPYLIC ALCOHOL IF CONTACT OCCURS. (1) Wipe the lens clean in order to remove any particles from the lens surface. (2) The next polishing steps are done by hands (manually) except the last step that could be done by using a Polisher air-powered. (3) Put the Micro-mesh sheet or polysand in the blue foam pad or equivalent soft material. It is recommended to use a lens shape molded foam blocks (this will reduce the hand and fingers stress during polishing steps).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Use moderate pressure over the lens surface and start polishing in cross (+) pattern and alternating way such one polishing in one direction (e.g. in flight direction) and the next transversely. Do not polish the lens in circular or X patterns. (5) Repeat the procedures changing the micro-mesh grit as necessary to obtain a new pattern more fine. Try to use the micro-mesh or polysand sheets with water (this will remove the fine abrasive particles from sheets avoiding to re-scratch the surface again). If you are polishing with dry sheet, after a few polishing time, remove the abrasive residues from sheets by passing the pad over other surface. (6) Start with 1500 Grit Micro-mesh and progressively change to next high grits such as 1800, 2400, 3200, 3600 and finally use the 4000 Grit Micro-mesh, the polishing time with each sheets is approximately 1 minute to 2 minutes, depending on surface condition. (7) Wash the lens surface with clean water, dry all surface and inspect visually for remaining scratches. (8) NOTE: During polishing procedures do not overheat the lens surface, the temperature must be kept from 48ÃÂ°C to 54ÃÂ°C. For final polishing step, use a air-powered Polisher tool with a clean buffer (at approximately 1800 RPM max.), polish with the polishing product and a cloth disc made with 70 to 100 clean flannel, the disc thickness will have 10 cm (4 in) to 20 cm (8 in), the polishing must be done using the thickness surface (tangent to surface). Use small pressure and a cross pattern (+) one of directions must be parallel to flight direction, try to avoid circular movements. (9) Hand-polish corners and edges, as necessary, with the aid of polishing product and a felt pad. (10) Wash the lens surface with clean water, dry all surface and inspect visually for remaining scratches. (11) The Final Cleaning is done by a dry clean and soft cloth. Clean the internal and external surfaces. (12) Do a final visual inspection for obvious damages and optical distortions. L. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the wing tip lens AMM TASK 57-30-01-400-801-A/400 to the wing tip. (2) Install the wing tip AMM TASK 57-30-00-400-801-A/400 to the aircraft.
