			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Get access to the area to be repaired. (2) Make sure that the aircraft is in a safe condition before you do the maintenance procedures. J. Repair (Figure 801)  SUBTASK 300-003-A (1) Find the extension of the damage (1). (2) With a porous-point pen marker (3), mark the contour (4) of the damage (1) in the vibration damper (2) (Figure 801, sheet 1, DET. A). NOTE: Mark the contour (4) in a regular geometric shape to make the remaining process easier. CAUTION: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE CUTTER, NOT TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE. (3) Use a cutter (5) to detach the aluminum foil (6) that covers the damaged vibration damper (Figure 801, sheet 1, DET. B). CAUTION: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU REMOVE THE REMAINING VIBRATION DAMPER, NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE. (4) Use an acrylic spatula (7) to release the remaining vibration damper (Figure 801, sheet 1, DET. C). NOTE: If necessary, use a plastic bottle with nozzle (8) to spray MEK to help loosen the remaining bond (Figure 801, sheet 2, DET. D). (5) With a cloth soaked in MEK, clean the surface. NOTE: • Make sure that the surface to be inspected is clean and without sealant residues, rubber, or oil. • Do a detailed inspection for scratches and other types of damage on the surface. If you find a damage, tell the Embraer Technical Support. (6) If applicable, restore the Corrosion-Inhibiting Compound (CIC), and wait its curing time. Refer to CPM 51-61-00. (7) Use the detached aluminum foil (6) as a template to mark a contour on the new vibration damper. (8) Use a pair of scissors to cut the new vibration damper in the marked area. (9) Identify the damaged vibration damper according to the Illustrated Parts Catalog (IPC). (10) For SD-40ALPSA vibration damper: fill in the gaps and voids around the damage border with sealant RTV 157 (Figure 801, sheet 2, DET. E). Refer to SRM 51-20-01. (11) Release the protective backing from the cut-out vibration damper to install it. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 CONFIG-1 51-70-00 Page 3 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
