(a) Set the horizontal stabilizer to the electrical zero position. Refer to AMM TASK 27-40-02-700-801-A/500. (b) Stabilizer straightedge GSE 141 is put on the horizontal stabilizer at four stations. There is one position for installation of the straightedge at each station. Install spindles to the straightedge assembly. Obey the instructions in Figure 212, sheet 2. NOTE: The spindle number is on the spindle body. (c) To do the check of the horizontal stabilizer dihedral and incidence, do as follows: NOTE: • To measure the left or right stabilizer incidence, the GSE 070 display must always point to the right side of the aircraft. • To measure the left or right stabilizer dihedral, the GSE 070 display must always point to the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer. • Write down in the tables the measured incidence and dihedral values with their correct mathematical signs. 1 Set digital protractor GSE 070 to true zero. NOTE: True zero is the factory-adjusted zero of the digital protractor. When the digital protractor is first set to on, the displayed angles will be in true zero. 2 Put straightedge GSE 141 on the left horizontal stabilizer, at station YH = - 350, between stations YH = - 30 and YH = - 670 at the second rivet row. Refer to Figure 212, sheet 2 to the correct setup of the straightedge. Put digital protractor GSE 070 on the straightedge. To measure the horizontal stabilizer dihedral, the digital protractor must be in the direction of the shorter arm of the straightedge. To measure the left horizontal stabilizer incidence, the digital protractor must be in the direction of the longer arm of the straightedge. 3 Write down the dihedral and incidence angles found in tables 212 and 213, respectively.

The pitch up value is considered positive and the pitch down value is considered negative. • If the value of a station is out of this range, contact the Embraer Technical Support Department. 4 Also at station YH = - 350, put digital protractor GSE 070 on the straightedge, in the direction of the longer arm of the straightedge. 5 Set digital protractor GSE 070 to relative zero. NOTE: • Relative zero is the inclination of a surface, used as a new (temporary) reference. In this case, we define the inclination of the longer arm of the straightedge as the new zero of the protractor. • To set the relative zero, put the protractor on the straightedge, wait 5 seconds and push the ALT ZERO button once. "Alt" will come into view on the display, followed by "-0-". The digital protractor will then show angles with the use of the new reference and a flashing dash will come into view on the lower right corner of the display. • Keep this adjustment to measure the relative incidence deviation at station YH = + 350. 6 Put straightedge GSE 141 on the right horizontal stabilizer, at station YH = + 350, between stations YH = + 30 and YH = + 670 at the second rivet row.

Refer to Figure 212, sheet 2 to the correct setup of the straightedge. Put digital protractor GSE 070 on the straightedge, in the direction of the longer arm of the straightedge. With the same adjustment of zero as adjusted at station YH = + 2270, measure the incidence relative deviation between the left and right horizontal stabilizers. 17 Negative or positive values smaller than 20' (0.3ÃÂ° on the GSE display) are acceptable. 18 If the value is out of this range, contact the Embraer Technical Support Department. 19 Set digital protractor GSE 070 to true zero. NOTE: Put the ALT ZERO button again to go back to true zero. The protractor digital also goes back to standard reference (true zero) when it is set to off or shuts off automatically. 20 Also at station YH = - 2270, put digital protractor GSE 070 on the straightedge. To measure the horizontal stabilizer dihedral, the digital protractor must be in the direction of the shorter arm of the straightedge. To measure the left horizontal stabilizer incidence, the digital protractor must be in the direction of the longer arm of the straightedge. 21 Write the dihedral and incidence angles found in tables 212 and 213, respectively. 22 Write down in table 214 the dihedral angles found, and calculate the dihedral relative deviation between the left and right horizontal stabilizers. NOTE: For this calculation, obey the correct mathematical signs of the values.
