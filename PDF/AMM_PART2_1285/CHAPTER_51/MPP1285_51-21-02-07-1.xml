			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Epoxy Primer - Preparation and Application SUBTASK 110-002-A (1) Prepare the epoxy primer for application under clean conditions with a clean and solvent- resistant container. Metal, polyethylene and polypropylene containers are recommended. Containers such as coated and non-coated paper cup can contaminate the paint or change the paint properties. (2) Shake each base component individually. Then mix them. (3) Prepare the epoxy primer in the volume ratio (base, catalyst, and thinner) specified by the manufacturer. NOTE: The catalyst must always be added to the base component and not in the opposite sequence. Adjust the viscosity for 17 ÃÂ± 1 sec in Cup Ford IV at the temperature of 18ÃÂ°C (64.4ÃÂ°F) to 35ÃÂ°C (95ÃÂ°F), by addition of thinner as specified by the manufacturer. (4) Before the application of the epoxy primer, permit a ÃÂ½-hour stand time after the mix of the base, catalyst and thinner (as specified). (5) Before the application, filter the mixture through an organdy fabric. (6) Apply one coat of epoxy primer with a spray gun and permit it to cure. Refer to the figure (Figure 701). NOTE: The drying time shown in figure 701 is given to make the production easier and it is not equivalent to the full cure of the coating. Full cure of the coating changes with the film thickness, temperature, humidity and color. Seven days are always necessary to get the optimum cure before the surface can be open to the weather and put back to service. The used temperature is 23ÃÂ°C ÃÂ± 3ÃÂ°C (75ÃÂ°F ÃÂ± 5ÃÂ°F). Forced drying temperatures will not decrease the time necessary for an optimum cure. The drying times given in figure 701 are for one-coat thickness. All times are approximate and must be increased in the same proportion as the thickness of the films increases. These items are approximate and must be used as a guideline only. K. Polyurethane Enamel - Preparation and Application SUBTASK 110-003-A NOTE: Before you apply the final painting, you can use polyester resin to make the surfaces smooth. Obey the product manufacturer's instruction. (1) Prepare the polyurethane enamel for application under clean conditions with a clean and solvent-resistant container. Metal, polyethylene and polypropylene container are recommended. Containers such as coated and non-coated paper cup can contaminate the paint or change the paint properties. (2) Shake each base component individually. Then mix them. (3) Prepare the polyurethane enamel in the volume ratio (base, catalyst, and thinner) specified by the manufacturer. NOTE: The catalyst must always be added to the base component and not in the opposite sequence.

(9) Polish the transparency as follows: (a) Apply Micro-Gloss 2 Ounce Liquid Abrasive to the transparency surface. Spread the polishing compound over the entire transparency surface with a clean, unused Cotton flannel cloth, in a linear pattern. NOTE: The Micro-Gloss 2 Ounce Liquid Abrasive is included in the Cushioned Abrasives Micro-mesh Kit -. (b) Polish the transparency using a buffing wheel moving it back and forth across the transparency surface. NOTE: Use the lateral of the buffing wheel to perform the polishing process to avoid circular movements. Use light pressure and keep buffer moving during the polishing operation to minimize heat buildup and the chance of localized distortion; After each polishing operation, trim loose cloth fibers/stringers from the buffing wheel with scissors. (10) Wipe the transparency surface with a dry Cotton flannel cloth to remove any residue that remains after polishing. (11) Measure the overall thickness of the transparency using an optical micrometer, ultrasonic thickness gage or equivalent depth measuring device. Check if it is within the allowable limits given in the respective SRM task. NOTE: The refractive index is given in the applicable task for the component you are polishing. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 940-002-A (1) Inspect the transparency for distortion. (2) If distortion exists and the transparency is still above the minimum thickness, repeat the sanding and polishing procedures. Otherwise, contact Embraer. NOTE: Begin in the area of the most severe distortion and work outwards from that location. (3) If you removed the component, install it. Refer to the applicable AMM task. (4) Put the aircraft back to its initial condition (AMM MPP 20-00-00/200). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 100-802-A/700 51-21-02 Page 10 of 12 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
