			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL FMS (HONEYWELL) - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH FMS HONEYWELL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to load databases into FMS Computer and to replace the FMS Computer Battery. B. The Honeywell data base contains worldwide coverage of navaids, airways, standard instrument departure/standard terminal arrival route (SID/STAR) procedures, airports, and runways. The data base can store flight plans and waypoints specified by the pilot. C. The Navigation data base in the FMS must be updated periodically. The update is supplied by Honeywell. D. The FMS must be configured to operate in the pattern mode. Thus, the EGPWS can operate correctly if there is a GPS failure. E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).
