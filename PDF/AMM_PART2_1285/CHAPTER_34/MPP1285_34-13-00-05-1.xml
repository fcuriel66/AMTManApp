			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the nose-landing-gear safety pin is installed. J. Functionally Check of Pitot/Static System for Leakage (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 790-002-A (1) Do the check as follows. WARNING: TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS, DO NOT TOUCH THE PITOT, PITOT/STATIC SENSORS, ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORTS, AND INTERNAL TUBES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE HEATER WAS TURNED OFF. CAUTION: • ALL THE CONNECTIONS FOR THIS CHECK MUST BE MADE EXTERNALLY. • IN A STATIC SYSTEM, THE RATE OF APPLICATION OR RELEASE OF VACUUM MUST NOT BE MORE THAN 5000 ft. PER MINUTE. • IN A PITOT SYSTEM, THE RATE OF APPLICATION OR RELEASE OF PRESSURE MUST NOT BE MORE THAN 300 KNOTS PER MINUTE. • TO PREVENT INCORRECT ALIGNMENT OF PITOT AND PITOT/ STATIC SENSORS, THE TEST HOSES MUST BE HELD NOT TO LET WEIGHT TO BE ADDED TO THE SENSORS. CAUTION: • MAKE SURE THAT THE SENSOR (PITOT 1/TAT 1/AOA 1, PITOT 2/TAT 2/AOA 2, PITOT/STATIC 3) PUSHBUTTONS, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET AT OFF AND ATTACH A DO-NOT- SET-TO-AUTO TAG TO THEM. • ON THE CIRCUIT BREAKER PANEL, ON THE COCKPIT CEILING, MAKE SURE THAT THE SENSORS HTG CIRCUIT BREAKER IS CLOSED. (a) Write the local altitude. (b) With a cross-fitting, connect the dynamic-pressure hoses to one another. (c) With a cross-fitting, connect the static-pressure hoses to one another. (d) Install the dynamic-pressure test adapters to pitot sensors 1 and 2. (e) Remove two screws from each of anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 for you to install the static-pressure test adapters. NOTE: Keep the removed screws in a safe location and install them back after the test. (f) Install the static-pressure test adapters to anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4. (g) Install the static/dynamic pressure test adapters to pitot/static sensor 3. (h) Install the adapters to the related hoses.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (i) Connect a hose between the cross-fitting of the dynamic-pressure line and the PT fitting of the pitot/static system test set. (j) Connect a hose between the cross-fitting of the static-pressure line and the PS fitting of the pitot/static system test set. (k) Energize the aircraft with the external DC-power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (l) Adjust the speed to 300 knots on the pitot/static-system test set. Result: 1 After one minute with no pumping, do a check to make sure that the leakage is not more than 5 knots on the two PFD airspeed indicators and standby IAS or ISIS. (m) On the pitot/static-system test set, set the airspeed to ZERO knots. (n) Adjust the altitude to 30000 ft. and the rate to 5000 ft. per minute on the pitot/ static-system test set. NOTE: This procedure can cause interference with the local air traffic during simulations of altitude with the anemometric bench test. To prevent this, make sure that the transponder is on the STANDBY condition (AMM SDS 34-52-00/1). Result: 1 After one minute with no pumping, make sure that the test-set (GSE 129) leakage indication is less than 100 ft. (o) On the pitot/static-system test set, set the altitude back to the local value. (p) Remove the dynamic lines from the adapters of pitot sensors 1 and 2, and of pitot/static sensor 3. (q) Remove the static line from the adapters of anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, and of pitot/static 3 sensor. (r) Remove the test adapters from pitot sensors 1 and 2. (s) Remove the test adapters from pitot/static sensor 3. (t) Remove the adapter test from anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4. (u) Apply Loctite adhesive on the surfaces of the screws of anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4. (v) Install the screws of anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4 back.  NOTE: Apply a torque of 2.26 - 2.48 N.m (20 - 22 lb.in) to the screws. (w) Remove the dynamic lines from the adapters of pitot sensors 1 and 2, and of pitot/static sensor 3. (x) Remove the static line from the adapters of anemometric static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4, and of pitot/static 3 sensor. (y) Remove the test adapters from pitot sensors 1 and 2. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 790-801-A/500 34-13-00 Page 4 of 18 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
