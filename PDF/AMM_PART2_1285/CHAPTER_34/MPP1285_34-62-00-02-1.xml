Loading Procedure (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 470-004-A (1) Do the loading of the world magnetic model as follows: NOTE: • (AIRCRAFT WITH DUAL FMS) This procedure must be performed on the two CDUs, so that the world magnetic model is updated on the two FMSs. • For details about the world magnetic model update kit (which contains the media with the software) and its relationship to the FMS software version (there is a specific update kit part number for each FMS software version (SCN) and data-transfer unit used), refer to the applicable service bulletin published by the FMS manufacturer. (a) Push the ON key on the PDTU or on the SSDTU. Result: 1 A 12-second self-test will occur. (b) On the CDU, push the PWR/DIM function key. Result: 1 When the initialization page comes into view, the system will be ready to get updates. (c) On the CDU, on the INIT page 1/1, record the FMS software version adjacent to line select key 5R (FMC VER) and make sure it is the same as the software version on the media with the world magnetic model that will be used to do the loading. NOTE: You can also check the FMS software version on the S/W VERSIONS page. To do this, push the DATA function key, then the MAINT line select key (5R) and then the S/W VERS line select key (5L). The FMS software version shows adjacent to line select key 2L (FMS). (d) Put the media with the world magnetic model into the PDTU or into the SSDTU and wait for the light on the data transfer unit to stop blinking. (e) On the CDU, push the DATA function key to show the DATA page 1/4. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 470-801-A/200 34-62-00 Page 18 of 19 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
