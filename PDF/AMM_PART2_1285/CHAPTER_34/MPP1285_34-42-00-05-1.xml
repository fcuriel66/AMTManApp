(1) Select the EFIS to show the weather radar information (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1), as follows: (a) On the display controllers (DC-550), on the glareshield panel, push the FULL/WX pushbutton, to start the WX mode on the PFDs. Result: 1 The PFDs show the WX inscription, in amber, on the left side. 2 The compass cards of the PFDs go to the ARC mode. (b) On the MFDs, push the WX mode pushbutton. Result: 1 The MFDs show the WX inscription, in amber, on the left lower corner. (2) Do the check of the weather radar system, as follows: NOTE: For aircraft with two radar controllers, do this check with the left (pilot) weather radar controller. (a) Set the RADAR rotary switch, on the weather radar controller, to OFF and make sure that the aircraft is on the ground. (b) Set the RADAR rotary switch, on the weather radar controller, to SBY. Result: 1 The PFDs and MFDs show the weather radar indications: • WAIT in green, on the mode field. • After ÃÂ± 90 seconds, the WAIT inscription is replaced by the FSBY inscription, also in green. (c) Set the RADAR rotary switch, on the weather radar controller, to WX. (d) With the aircraft on the ground configuration, push four (4) times the STAB pushbutton in less than 3 seconds on the weather radar controller, to enter the forced standby override.
