(4) On the Mode Select Unit (MSU), make sure that the rotary switch is in the OFF position. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that the IRS circuit breaker is closed. J. Single IRS - Test Procedures (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do the IRS power-up and alignment test as follows: (a) Make sure that the Combiner shows flags ATT FAIL and HDG FAIL. (b) Turn the MSU rotary switch to the ALIGN position. – The ALIGN annunciator (amber) comes on. – The ON BATT and the NO AIR annunciators (amber) may come on momentarily. (c) NOTE: • The IRS must receive the present position for the alignment to be completed. The FMS position must be updated to permit this data to be read by the IRS. • If the aircraft is moved during the alignment, the IRU stops the alignment and starts a full alignment again 30 seconds after the motion stops. On the INIT 1/1 page, on FMS CDU1, push the ACCEPT line select key to update the FMS position. (d) Wait until the alignment is completed. The alignment time depends on the local latitude. The time of alignment is less than 10 minutes for latitudes of less than 70.25 degrees. • After the alignment of the IRS is completed, the NAV RDY annunciator (green) comes on. (e) Turn the MSU rotary switch to the NAV position. • The ALIGN and NAV RDY annunciators go out of the MSU. • The flags ATT FAIL and HDG FAIL go out of the Combiner, and a valid attitude and heading data are shown. (2) Do the IRS test by the MSU test switch as follows: (a) On the MSU, push the TEST switch. Result: 1 All MSU annunciators come on for eight seconds. 2 The Combiner shows the ATT TEST and HDG TEST.

(2) Attach the tray to the aircraft structure, but keep the four bolts loose. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU INSTALL THE LEVELING DEVICE (GSE 124) ON THE MOUNTING TRAY AND WHEN YOU MAKE THE MEASUREMENTS TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE PRECISION INSTRUMENT. (3) Install the leveling device (GSE 124) in place of the IRU Computer with the three guide pins on the mounting tray. (4) Attach the leveling device with the two knurled clamp knobs over the supporting hooks. (5) Examine the circular level on the leveling device and adjust the IRU Mounting Tray with shims as necessary to get better than 0 ÃÂ± 0.1 degrees of level in pitch and roll. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE IRU MOUNTING TRAY CANNOT "ROCK" ON THE MOUNTING FEET. (6) Remove the leveling device from the IRU Mounting Tray. (7) Make sure that the IRS circuit breaker, on the circuit breaker panel, is open. (8) Install the IRU computer in the IRU Mounting Tray ( AMM TASK 34-26-01-400-801-A/ 400).

Alignment of the IRU Mounting Tray SUBTASK 710-004-A (1) Note the angle of the true heading of the reference line (H ) in relation to the true north. T (2) Make sure that the aircraft is level. (3) Put plumb bobs at points 1 (Zones 123 and 124) and 9 (Zones 311 and 312) under the fuselage of the aircraft along the longitudinal axis to determine the true heading of the aircraft (H ). A NOTE: The plumb bob must not touch the ground, but it must be as near as possible. (4) Wait the plumb bob to stabilize and, after that, mark the projection of its tip on a piece of adhesive tape put on the ground. (5) Determine the distances L, D , and D , with a tape measure (Figure 503). 1 2 • Where: L = Length of aircraft between plumb bobs (mm or in.). L is always positive. D = Displacement of the plumb bob at the front of the aircraft (mm or in.). D is 1 1 positive if the plumb bob is at the right of the reference line, when you look from the rear to the nose of the aircraft. D = Displacement of the plumb bob at the rear of the aircraft (mm or in.). D is 2 2 positive if the plumb bob is at the left of the reference line, when you look from the rear to the nose of the aircraft. NOTE: • D and D must be perpendicular to the reference line (true north or 1 2 known true heading). • D and D must be measured with an accuracy of 1 mm (or 1/8 in.). 1 2 (6) Use this equation to determine the true heading of the aircraft (H ): A -1 H = H + Sin [(D + D )/L] degrees A T 1 2 – Where: H = True heading of the aircraft (in decimal degrees). A H = True heading of the surveyed line (in decimal degrees). T EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-802-A/500 34-26-00 Page 10 of 16 Rev 49 - Feb  16/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
