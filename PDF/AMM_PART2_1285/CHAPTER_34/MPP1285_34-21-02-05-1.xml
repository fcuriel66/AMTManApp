			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Make sure that the systems below are serviceable: – Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1). – Air Data System (AMM SDS 34-15-00/1). – Integrated Computer System (AMM SDS 31-42-00/1). J. Functional Test (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Make sure that these conditions occur: • Engines in operation and throttles in the idle position. • Panel lights off and radios on. • Magnetic materials removed in a radius of 60 meters (197 feet) and from the personnel outside the aircraft. • Make sure that this area is free of buried metal objects. • Generators on and air conditioning off. • Navigation lights and strobe lights on. • All the heating must be off. (2) Turn on all the systems of the aircraft, but do not turn on the systems recommended above to be off. (3) On the control panels of AHRS1 and 2, put the DG/SLVD switch to the SLVD position. (4) Head the aircraft to the North as follows: NOTE: If the compass rose is not available, use the landing compass (GSE 342) as an alternative method. (a) (If the compass rose is available) With the aircraft in position on the compass rose, tie plumb bobs to each main landing gear, and head the aircraft to the North. For this, use the East-West reference line with the plumb bobs aligned with it (GSE 005) with a tolerance of 0.5 degrees (Figure 501). (b) (If the compass rose is not available) Use the landing compass (GSE 342) as an alternative method (Figure 502) to assure the heading of the aircraft as follows: 1 Put the non-magnetic tripod (GSE 343) on the same line as the longitudinal axis of the aircraft  and within 20 to 25 meters (66 to 82 feet) of the nose of the aircraft. NOTE: You can use the plumb bobs (GSE 005) at points 1 (Zone 123 and 124) and 3 (Zone 141 and 142) under the fuselage of the aircraft and use a line to connect their projections on the ground and EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 34-21-02 Page 3 of 15 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL extend this line until the necessary distance to put the tripod, to make easier the alignment of the tripod with the longitudinal axis of the aircraft. 2 Install the landing compass (GSE 342) on the tripod. 3 Lift the sight of the landing compass. 4 Level the landing compass. For this, use its spirit level. 5 Adjust the landing compass to view the center of the windshield and the vertical stabilizer through its sight. 6 Make sure that the landing compass is still leveled. If not, do steps d and e again to aim at the center of the windshield and at the vertical stabilizer with the landing compass leveled. NOTE: Make sure that there is no magnetic material or metallic object (for example, vehicle, hangar or other aircraft) next to the landing compass that can interfere with its reading. 7 Read (up to one decimal place) and write down the heading indicated on the reverse reading card of the landing compass. This reading is the magnetic heading of the aircraft. NOTE: The magnetic heading must have an accuracy of ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees for the results of the compass swing to give a system accuracy of ÃÂ± 1.0 degrees. 8 Remove the landing compass from the tripod. 9 Disassemble the tripod. (5) Make sure that the heading presented on MFD is within ÃÂ± 2 degrees of the magnetic heading of the aircraft. (6) Head the aircraft to East as follows: NOTE: If the compass rose is not available, use the landing compass (GSE 342) as an alternative method. (a) (If the compass rose is available) With the aircraft in position on the compass rose, tie plumb bobs to each main landing gear, and head the aircraft to the East. For this, use the North-South reference line with the plumb bobs aligned with it (GSE 005) with a tolerance of 0.5 degrees (Figure 501). (7) Make sure that the heading presented on MFD is within ÃÂ± 2 degrees of the magnetic heading of the aircraft. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Remove the plumb bobs from each main landing gear (Figure 501).

Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Open access door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the AHRS1 and AHRS2 circuit breakers. (3) On the ELECTRICAL panel, on the overhead panel, push the BACKUP pushbutton (striped bar comes on). (4) Connect the interface box (GSE 135) to the maintenance panel and to the PC comm port. (5) Energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (6) Get the initial magnetic heading of the aircraft as follows: NOTE: To get the initial magnetic heading of the aircraft, you can use the compass rose or if it is not available you can use the landing compass (GSE 342) as an alternative method. (a) (If the compass rose is available) With the aircraft in position on the compass rose, tie plumb bobs to each main landing gear, and head the aircraft to the North. For this, use the East-West reference line with the plumb bobs aligned with it (GSE 005) with a tolerance of 0.5 degrees (Figure 501). NOTE: (AHRS Calibration Software DOS version) In this case, with the aircraft headed to North, the initial magnetic heading is 360 degrees, which will be the first heading to be used for the compensation of the flux detector units. (b) (If the compass rose is not available) Use the landing compass (GSE 342) as an alternative method (Figure 502) to get the initial magnetic heading of the aircraft as follows: 1 Put the aircraft in a flat area free of electromagnetic interference. NOTE: • Make sure that there is no magnetic material or metallic object (for example, vehicle, hangar or other aircraft) in a radius of 60 meters (197 feet) from the aircraft. • Make sure that this area is free of buried metal objects. 2 Do these steps to read the initial magnetic heading of the aircraft with the landing compass: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 820-801-A/500 34-21-02 Page 8 of 15 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

(5) Turn on all the systems of the aircraft, but do not turn on the systems recommended above to be off. (6) On the circuit breaker panel, close the AHRS1 and AHRS2 circuit breakers. (7) Stop for approximately two minutes until the AHRSs initialize. (8) Stop for approximately two minutes after the AHRSs are in full performance mode. (9) Turn the PC on. NOTE: (AHRS Calibration Software DOS version) The MS-DOS mode is necessary for the AHRS Calibration Software DOS version to operate. Select: "Restart the computer in the MS-DOS mode" (do not use the MS-DOS prompt icon of the Windows Desktop). (10) Start the AHRS Calibration Software. (a) (AHRS Calibration Software DOS version) Go to the directory where the AHRS Calibration Software is installed. Type "MA" and then push the ENTER key to run the AHRS software. NOTE: If the program is installed in the "C:\AHRS" directory, type "cd C:\AHRS" to go to this directory. (b) (AHRS Configuration Software Windows version) Click on the link to the AHRS Calibration Software. NOTE: Typically the name of the software link on the Start menu is "pcma_cal". (11) From the main menu, choose MEMORY ACCESS TESTS and then INTERFACE TEST. Make sure that the tests for memory access writing and reading passed. (12) On GSE 135, move the AHRS 1/2 switch to 2 and do the INTERFACE TEST again. Make sure that the tests for memory access write and read passed.
