Installation SUBTASK 420-005-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is in the same configuration as it was at the end of the removal task ( AMM TASK 34-62-04-000-802-A/400). (2) Use a workstand (external top fuselage) to get access to the installation position of the FMS GPS antenna (2). (3) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT DO NOT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET ) To install the FMS GPS antenna, do as follows: (Figure 403) WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK). PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES, PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE GAS. DO THE WORK IN AN AREA WHICH HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK) IS POISONOUS AND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. (a) With a clean cloth soaked in Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), clean the antenna base surface. CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL BONDING GIVES A GOOD ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVE PATH. IF NOT, DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (b) Do the bonding procedure, method 12, on the antenna installation surface on the aircraft skin (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200) (c) Put the FMS GPS antenna (2) in its installation position.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (d) Install the screws (1). (e) Use a torque wrench to torque the screws (1) to 2.8 N.m (25 lb.in) in a crisscross pattern. (f) Do the bonding test between the connector of the FMS GPS antenna (2) and aircraft ground (AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/200). (g) Apply aerodynamic sealant P/S870 B-2 around the contour of the FMS GPS antenna (2), on the skin (SRM 51-20-01). (h) Apply sealant 780 (WHITE) on the screw heads until you fully fill the recesses on the antenna body (SRM 51-20-01). (i) Apply sealant PR1422 B-2 around the fuselage skin hole and the FMS GPS antenna base, on the inner surface of the fuselage skin (SRM 51-20-01). CAUTION: LOOK AT THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COAXIAL CONNECTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE THE CORRECT CONNECTIONS. INCORRECT CONNECTIONS CAN CAUSE MALFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENT. (j) Connect the coaxial connector (3) to the FMS GPS antenna (2). (4) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET) To install the FMS GPS antenna (2), do as follows: (Figure 404) WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK). PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES, PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE GAS. DO THE WORK IN AN AREA WHICH HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK) IS POISONOUS AND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. (a) With a clean cloth soaked in Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), clean the antenna base surface. (b) Carefully remove the protective release film identified with "ANTENNA SIDE" from the gel conductive gasket (3). (c) Carefully align the gel conductive gasket (3) with the screw holes and connector, and install it to the base of the FMS GPS antenna (2). (d) Carefully remove the protective release film identified with "AIRCRAFT SIDE" from the gel conductive gasket (3). CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL BONDING GIVES A GOOD ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVE PATH. IF NOT, DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (e) Do the bonding procedure, method 12, on the antenna installation surface on the aircraft skin (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200) (f) Put the FMS GPS antenna (2) in its installation position.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (h) Use a torque wrench to torque the screws (1) to 2.8 N.m (25 lb.in) in a crisscross pattern. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (i) If necessary, with a spatula, remove the excess gel of the conductive gel gasket (3) from around the FMS GPS antenna (2) and from the aircraft skin. (j) Do the bonding test between the connector of the FMS GPS antenna (2) and aircraft ground (AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/200). (k) Apply aerodynamic sealant P/S870 B-2 around the contour of the FMS GPS antenna (2), on the skin (SRM 51-20-01). (l) Apply paint ECL-G-46/PC-233/TR109 on the screw heads (CPM 51-21-06). (m) Apply sealant 780 (WHITE) on the screw heads until you fully fill the recesses in the antenna body (SRM 51-20-01). (n) Apply sealant PR1422 B-2 around the fuselage skin hole and the FMS GPS antenna base, on the inner surface of the fuselage skin (SRM 51-20-01). CAUTION: LOOK AT THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COAXIAL CONNECTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE THE CORRECT CONNECTIONS. INCORRECT CONNECTIONS CAN CAUSE MALFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENT. (o) Connect the coaxial connector (4) to the FMS GPS antenna (2). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-005-A (1) Remove all tools, equipment and unwanted materials from the work area. (2) Install the ceiling panel (AMM MPP 06-41-04/100). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the FMS 1 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from it. (4) Do the Single FMS GPS System Operational Test ( AMM TASK 34-62-00-700-802-A/ 500). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 34-62-04 Page 19 of 19 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
