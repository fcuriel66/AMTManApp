TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (b) Use a spatula to remove the sealant from around the fuselage skin hole and the TCAS top antenna (1), on the inner surface of the fuselage skin hole. (c) Use a workstand (external top fuselage) to get access to the TCAS top antenna (1). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (d) Use a spatula to remove the sealant from around the TCAS top antenna (1) and from the aircraft skin. (e) Remove the sealant used as a protection of the screws (2). (f) Remove the screws (2) and washers (3). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (g) Use a spatula between the baseplate of the TCAS top antenna (1) and the aircraft skin to make the separation. (h) Carefully pull the TCAS top antenna (1) away from the fuselage. (i) Remove the TCAS top antenna (1). (j) Remove the O-ring (6). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 34-43-02 Page 3 of 12 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
