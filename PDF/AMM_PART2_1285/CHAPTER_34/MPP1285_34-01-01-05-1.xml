			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Cockpit 1 Does the task Pitot/static system test set I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Energize the aircraft with the external DC power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the INTEG STBY (Location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/INTEG STBY) circuit breaker. (3) Make sure that the systems below are serviceable: • Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1). • AHRS (AMM SDS 34-21-00/1) or IRS (AMM SDS 34-27-00/1). J. Functionally Check Integrated Standby Instrument System - ISIS (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  (Figure 504)  (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 720-003-A NOTE: ISIS pushbuttons must be held down for a minimum of 2 seconds to have an effect. (1) Do the ISIS initialization test as follows: NOTE: Make sure that there is no dynamic pressure applied to PITOT/STATIC 3 equivalent to airspeed equal or greater than 60 knots before turning on the ISIS. (a) On the circuit breaker panel, close the INTEG STBY (Location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/INTEG STBY) circuit breaker. Result: 1 The display shows an initialization page for 90 seconds (Figure 501). WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE PITOT/STATIC SENSOR AND ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORT HEATING SYSTEM IS OFF. THIS WILL PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS IF TOUCHED AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE TEST SET ADAPTERS. (2) Connect the pitot/static system test set (GSE 129) ( AMM TASK 34-13-00-400-801-A/ 400). NOTE: This procedure can cause interference with the local air traffic during simulations of altitude with the anemometric bench test. To prevent this, make sure that the transponder is on the STANDBY condition (AMM SDS 34-52-00/1). NOTE: For the ISIS test, it is necessary to connect the pitot/static 3 adapter only. (3) Do the ISIS airspeed test with the pitot/static system test set as follows (Figure 502): EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 34-01-01 Page 3 of 22 Rev 50 - Apr 29/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Apply pressures to pitot/static 3 equivalent to the airspeed shown in the table below. Make sure that the airspeed values on the ISIS obey the tolerances for each test point. • On the pitot/static system test set, keep the altitude open to the room pressure. Table 501 AIRSPEED ISIS INDICATED VALUE 40 kts 40 kts (ÃÂ± 5 kts) 70 kts 70 kts (ÃÂ± 4 kts) 100 kts 100 kts (ÃÂ± 3 kts) 140 kts 140 kts (ÃÂ± 3 kts) 180 kts 180 kts (ÃÂ± 5 kts) 200 kts 200 kts (ÃÂ± 5 kts) 300 kts 300 kts (ÃÂ± 5 kts) 350 kts 350 kts (ÃÂ± 5 kts) (b) On the pitot/static system test set, set the airspeed back to zero. (4) Do the ISIS VMO test with the pitot/static system test set as follows (Figure 502): (a) Set on the pitot/static system test set altitude values that obey the table below and change the airspeed, at a rate of 30 knots per minute, for the VMO alarm check . NOTE: Make sure that the airspeed values on the ISIS obey the tolerances for each test point. Result: 1 Airspeed values greater than VMO are indicated through a red strip on the left-hand side associated to the airspeed scale of the ISIS airspeed display window (Figure 504).The VMO value is computed internally according to the actual altitude. 2 The MACH number is displayed in green under the airspeed scale. The MACH number indication is displayed only when M&gt;0.45 (Figure 505). When the actual airspeed is greater than VMO or when the MACH number is greater than MMO, the MACH indication turns red (Figure 505).
