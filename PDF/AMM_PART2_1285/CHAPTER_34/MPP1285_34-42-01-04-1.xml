			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Removal (Figure 403)  SUBTASK 020-003-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE WEATHER RADAR POWER IS OFF AND THE ANTENNA CANNOT SCAN. INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR IF THE WEATHER RADAR TRANSMITS OR IF THE ANTENNA IS PERMITTED TO SCAN. CAUTION: BE VERY CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HIGH VOLTAGE CABLE TO THE MAGNETRON IS NOT PINCHED BETWEEN THE FLAT PLATE ATTACHING STUDS AND THE RTA BODY. IF THE CABLE IS DAMAGED, ARCING AND EXPENSIVE DAMAGE CAN RESULT. (1) Remove the weather radar flat plate as follows: (a) Hold the flat plate antenna (3) and remove the seven screws (1) and lock washers (2) that attach it to the weather RTA (4) shown by arrows. Refer to Figure 403. NOTE: • The screws that attach the flat plate are behind it and they are shown by arrows. • You can carefully move the flat plate antenna, to get access to each screw that attaches it to the weather RTA. • If there is a clamp (5) installed with the bottom screw, take care not to loosen it from the weather RTA cables. If you will not immediately install a new flat plate antenna (3) in the weather RTA (4), you can attach the clamp to the weather RTA with a tie-down strap. (2) If you will not immediately install a new flat plate antenna (3) in the weather RTA (4), install the protective device in the hole of the wave guide, on the weather RTA (4).
