			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL RVSM CRITICAL REGION - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  RVSM COMPLIANT AIRCRAFT 1. General A. The function of the one-thousand foot Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) is to permit the aircraft to operate with a reduced vertical separation of 1000 ft. from other aircraft between flight level 290 and flight level 410. Then it is necessary to establish the airframe geometry variance that is an important source of Altimetry System Error (ASE). B. This section gives the procedures to do the geometric inspection of the fuselage critical region around the static ports. C. The AMM TASK 34-13-04-200-801-A/600 permits you to quantify the essential variations in the static port installation and fuselage contour deviations (waviness). D. The AMM TASK 34-13-04-200-802-A/600 permits you to inspect the static port surrounding plate for flushness and integrity. E. For Aircraft with Oxygen Servicing Panel closed with screws, the AMM TASK 34-13-04-200-803- A/600 permits you do the geometric inspection of the Oxygen Servicing Panel surrounding for flushness and integrity. F. First, do AMM TASK 34-13-04-200-802-A/600 and make sure that all measures are in the specified tolerances. Then, do AMM TASK 34-13-04-200-801-A/600 and send the test results as given in the procedure. G. Do not use the "Embraer SWSS (Pass-Fail).xls" tool on aircraft that got damage or repairs in the RVSM critical region. Such cases must be sent directly to Aeromech by e-mail emb.rvsm@aeromechinc.com . H. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Select the RVSM Resources drop down tab and then select Reference Documents. Find the Embraer 135/145 Skin Waviness Spreadsheet, file name EmbraerSWSS(Pass-Fail). The direct link to this file is: http:www.aeromechinc.com/docs/ EmbraerSWSS(Pass-Fail).xls Click the download button. • A File Download window will appear and will ask if you want to open or save the file. Click on the Save button. • A Save As window will appear and will ask you where on your computer you want save the file. Specify the location you want the file saved. c Open the file you just saved. A Security Warning window may appear notifying you that the file contains macros. Click on the Enable Macros button. d A Password window will appear. Type in the password: TRP*060460 ( note the password is case sensitive). Click on the OK button. e On the file EmbraerSWSS(Pass-Fail).xls, in the Measurement Data tab, fill in the "Airplane Information" table (Figure 608). For the model, enter BASIC in Cell M10. For S/N, enter the serial number in cell M11. Make sure you use the serial number format prompted on the spreadsheet. If you place the cursor over cell M11, a comment box will appear that shows the serial number format. After you have inputted the aircraft serial number, a red note to the right of the cell M11 will indicate whether the aircraft is eligible to use EmbraerSWSS(Pass- Fail).xls. If the aircraft is NOT eligible, go to step 26. f You must use the Microsoft Excel commands COPY and PASTE to transfer the measurement data (the blue numbers in cells E6:E592 and I6:I592) from Contour Data Spreadsheet to the Measurement Data tab (the blue numbers in cells D9:D595 and H9:H595) on the Embraer SWSS(Pass-Fail).xls, respectively (Figure 609). g On the EmbraerSWSS(Pass-Fail).xls, open the Measurement Data Check tab, review the graphs for each waterline, beginning with the first graph (WL-10 LHS/ WL-10 RHS) on the top (Figure 610). h Look for spikes or bad data points in the graphs. These graphs do NOT show the actual skin bumps or skin depressions, but just show the actual measurement data points (Figure 611). NOTE: 1. For spikes in the graphs you must change the peak value for the medium value of amplitude. For this you must calculate the arithmetic average between the previous and later amplitude value (Figure 612), then you must replace the old value in the respective cell for the new one (Figure 613).

Inspection of Static Port Surrounding Plate for Flushness and Integrity SUBTASK 280-003-A (1) Do the steps that follow for the inspection: (a) Open the IE-130 MSExcel file. (b) Make a hardcopy of LHS-RHS Spreadsheet (Figure 615). It will be used to record the test data. (c) Do the zero procedure of the GE-450 Dial Indicator (Figure 616) as follows: 1 Clean the GE-4 Gaging Assembly, the Gage Block, and the GE-450 Dial Indicator. 2 Put the GE-4 Gaging Assembly on the Gage Block. 3 Set the GE-450 Dial Indicator to read 0.000 in. NOTE: Make sure that the GE-450 Dial Indicator needle moves clockwise from zero when the plunger is pushed in and counterclockwise from zero when the plunger is extended. 4 Put an adhesive tape to hold the indicator bezel. 5 Remove the GE-4 Gaging Assembly and store the Gage Block. (d) Do the static port measurements relative to the surrounding plate as follows: 1 Write the airplane information (Aircraft S/N, Operator, Date and Notes) on the LHS/RHS Step-Height spreadsheet (Figure 615). 2 Clean with MEK the surface of the flush static port(s) and fuselage in the measurement region. Examine and write possible damage to port(s) on the LHS/RHS Step-Height spreadsheet in the notes/comments field. 3 Put the GE-4 Gaging Assembly onto the static port (upper or lower). NOTE: The base of the GE-4 Gaging Assembly will be put on the static port and the plunger will touch the surrounding plate. 4 Move to the measurement point, as shown the on LHS/RHS Step-Height spreadsheet (Figure 615), and write the step height indication on it. NOTE: • The GE-450 Dial Indicator indication is negative when the needle moves clockwise from zero and positive when the needle moves counterclockwise from zero. • When the indication is negative, it means that the static port is inboard in relation to the surrounding plate.
