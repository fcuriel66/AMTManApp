			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the VOR/ILS 1 or VOR/ILS 2 circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (3) Remove access panels 324DL and 325KR (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100). J. Removal SUBTASK 020-002-A (1) Put the hydraulic platform (GSE 036) at the necessary height. (2) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT DO NOT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET). To remove the VOR/LOC antenna, do as follows: (Figure 401). CAUTION: IDENTIFY THE COAXIAL CONNECTORS TO PREVENT A POSSIBLE INVERSION DURING THE INSTALLATION. INCORRECT CONNECTIONS CAN CAUSE MALFUNCTION OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENT. (a) Disconnect the coaxial connector (4) from the VOR/LOC antenna (3). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (b) Use a spatula to remove the sealant from around the fuselage skin hole and the VOR/LOC antenna (3), on the inner surface of the fuselage skin hole. (c) Use a spatula to remove the sealant from around the VOR/LOC antenna (3) and from the aircraft skin. (d) Remove the screws (2) and washers (1). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (e) Use a spatula between the baseplate of the VOR/LOC antenna (3) and the aircraft skin to make the separation. (f) Carefully pull the VOR/LOC antenna (3) away from the fuselage. (g) Remove the VOR/LOC antenna (3). (3) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET) To remove the VOR/LOC antenna, do as follows: (Figure 402). CAUTION: IDENTIFY THE COAXIAL CONNECTORS TO PREVENT A POSSIBLE INVERSION DURING THE INSTALLATION. INCORRECT CONNECTIONS CAN CAUSE MALFUNCTION OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENT. (a) Disconnect the coaxial connector (5) from the VOR/LOC antenna (4). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 34-32-03 Page 3 of 10 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
