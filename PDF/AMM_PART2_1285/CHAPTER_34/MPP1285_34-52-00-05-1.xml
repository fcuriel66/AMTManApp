			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 34-52-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. TRANSPONDER SYSTEM - FUNCTIONAL CHECK A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the functional check of the Mode-S Transponder system. (2) This task is applicable to aircraft equipped with one or two transponders. If only one transponder is installed, ignore the steps related to transponder 2. (3) This procedure has the potential to cause interference with the local air traffic. Notify the local ATC (Air Traffic Controller) that the transponder test is in progress, if applicable. (4) RF I/O Coax Connector Assy (GSE 476) must be used in the procedure if it is required to avoid possible interferences with local air traffic when simulate aircraft on flight. (5) Either ATC-601 (GSE 125 or GSE 303) or IFR6000 (GSE 475) Test Sets can be used to simulate interrogation modes and analyze reply puses. (6) (AIRCRAFT POST-MOD S.B.145-34-0089 or POST-MOD S.B. 145-34-0096) Either TCAS-201 (GSE 190 or GSE 304) or IFR6000 (GSE 475) Test Sets can be used to simulate air traffic. (7) The S.B.145-34-0089 refers to Mode S Transponder for Elementary Surveillance. (8) The S.B.145-34-0096 refers to Mode S Transponder for Enhanced Surveillance. B.
