(a) Open a caliper until you read 0.025 inch (0.635 mm) on the scale and lock it. (b) Use the caliper to find if there is a flat greater than 0.025 in (0.635mm) on the pitot lip. (c) Choose at least eight points around the lip, so that they cover the majority of its contour. (d) If damage exceeds the limit, replace the respective pitot sensor (AMM MPP 34-13-01/400). (4) For pitot dent in, do as follows. Refer to Figure 608. (a) With a caliper, measure the pitot lip diameter in the dent in area. Make sure that the diameter you find is above 0.360 inch (9.144 mm). (b) With a 10x magnifier, check the extent of the dent on the pitot lip and draw the affected area over the drawing line on Figure 608. (c) Make sure that the damage does not exceed 20% of the circumference, represented by the shaded area on the drawing. (d) If damage exceeds the limit, replace the respective pitot sensor (AMM MPP 34-13-01/400). (5) For pitot flare out, do as follows. Refer to Figure 609.

(b) Choose at least four points over the longitudinal axis of the pitot, so that they cover the majority of the lip. (a) Method 2: Lean a square edge over the longitudinal axis of the pitot. (b) Use a feeler gauge to check if the distance between the square edge and pitot lip is not greater than 0.015 inch (0.381 mm). (c) Choose at least four points over the longitudinal axis of the pitot, so that they cover the majority of the lip. (d) If damage exceeds the limit, replace the respective pitot sensor (AMM MPP 34-13-01/400). (7) For pitot nick, do as follows. Refer to Figure 611. (a) Open the caliper until you read 0.080 inch (2.032 mm) on the scale. (b) Put one of the inside jaws on the nick edge. (c) With a rigid ruler, push carefully the other inside jaw in the direction of the pitot lip until the ruler faces it completely. (d) Read the caliper scale and make sure it does not exceed 0.060 inch (1.524 mm) if there is only one nick, or 0.050 inch (1.27 mm) if there are two nicks. (e) If the damage exceeds the limit, replace the respective pitot sensor (AMM MPP 34-13-01/400). K. Pitot Sensor 3 - Damage Assessment SUBTASK 220-003-A (1) Do a visual inspection of the static pressure ports as follows. Refer to Figure 612. WARNING: TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS, DO NOT TOUCH THE PITOT, PITOT/ STATIC SENSORS, ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORTS, AND INTERNAL TUBES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE HEATER WAS TURNED OFF. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU TOUCH SHARP EDGES. THEY CAN CAUSE INJURIES TO YOUR FINGERS. (a) With a 10x magnifier, do a visual inspection on the static pressure ports to make sure that the edges are sharp. (b) With a 10x magnifier, look for scratches on the area around the static pressure ports (0.5 inch (12.7mm) from the ports).
