CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (f) Use a spatula between the baseplate of the TCAS bottom antenna (2) and the aircraft skin to make the separation. (g) Carefully pull the TCAS bottom antenna (2) away from the fuselage. (h) Remove the TCAS bottom antenna (2). (2) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET) To remove TCAS bottom antenna, do as follows: (Figure 402) (a) Disconnect the coaxial connector (1) from the TCAS bottom antenna (2). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA.
