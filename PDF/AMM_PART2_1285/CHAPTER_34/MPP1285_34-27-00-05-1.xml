(4) Make sure that the rotary switch, on MSU1 and MSU2, are in the OFF position. (5) Make sure that the IRS1 and IRS2 circuit breakers, on the circuit breaker panel, are closed. J. Dual IRS - Test Procedures (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 710-002-A NOTE: During the test, the SPS ADVANCED message can come into view on the EICAS display. After the test, the message must go out of view. (1) Do the IRS1 power-up and alignment test: (a) Make sure that PFD1 shows red flags ATT FAIL and HDG FAIL. (b) Make sure that MFD1 shows a red flag HDG FAIL. (c) Turn the MSU1 rotary switch to the ALIGN position. – The ALIGN annunciator (amber) lights. – The ON BATT and the NO AIR annunciators (amber) may come on momentarily. (d) NOTE: • The IRS must receive the present position for the alignment to be completed. The FMS position must be updated to permit this data to be read by the IRS. • If the aircraft is moved during the alignment, the IRU stops the alignment and starts a full alignment again 30 seconds after the motion stops. Do the FMS position update as follows: 1 On FMS1 or FMS2, push the NAV mode key and the NEXT function key. – The NAV INDEX 2/2 page is shown. 2 Push the POS INIT (3L) left line select key. – The POS INIT 1/1 page is shown. 3 Push the LOAD (2R) right line select key to update the FMS position with the last saved position. – The CDU shows the LOADED POSITION coordinates. (e) Wait until the alignment is completed. The alignment time depends on the local latitude. The time of alignment is less than 10 minutes for latitudes of less than 70.25 degrees. • After the alignment of the IRS is completed, the NAV RDY annunciator (green) comes on.
