			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to clean the pitot and static lines. B. The cleaning of the pitot and static lines is done with the application of dry air or dry nitrogen with a pressure equivalent to 25 psi to the tubing in the pitot sensor-to-instrument or anemometric sensor port-to-instrument directions. C. The aircraft has two pitot sensors (Pitot 1 and 2 sensors), four anemometric-static ports (Anemometric-Static ports 1, 2, 3, and 4), and one pitot/static sensor (Pitot/Static sensor 3). D. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).
