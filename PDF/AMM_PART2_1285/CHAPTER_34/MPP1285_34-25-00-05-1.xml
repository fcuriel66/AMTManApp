Standby Magnetic Compass - Compensation Procedures (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 720-002-A NOTE: Make sure that the conditions that follow are correct before you do the aircraft swing: • To point the aircraft to each heading, you can use a compass rose area with plumb bob, aircraft heading from AHRS 900 or IRS, or a landing compass. If you use the compass rose with plumb bob or landing compass, refer to AMM TASK 34-25-00-700-802-A/500. • Make sure that all aircraft headings have a precision of ÃÂ± 1.0 degree. • The technician must not wear any jewelry or objects that could cause magnetic interference. (1) Point the aircraft to each cardinal heading (N-E-S-W) and, at each heading, find and write the deviations discrepancies between the standby compass and the reference as follows: (a) Use the positive (+) sign for indications higher than the reference indication. (b) Use the negative (-) sign for indications lower than the reference indication. (2) Calculate coefficient A (Installation error) as follows: NOTE: The additions are done algebraically. Coef A = [(dn) + (de) + (ds) + (dw)] / 4. (3) With the aircraft on a cardinal heading, correct for the A coefficient as follows: (a) Use a nonmagnetic screwdriver to loosen the mounting screws on the compass support bottom. NOTE: Move the compass support clockwise, as seen from above, to correct a positive A coefficient or counterclockwise to correct a negative A coefficient. (b) Turn the standby compass support to get the coefficient A added to the present compass reading.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Tighten the mounting screws of the standby magnetic compass loosened in step (a). (4) Do step (1) again and use the formulas below to calculate coefficients B and C with the new deviations values found. Coef B = [(dE) - (dW)] / 2. Coef C = [(dN) - (dS)] / 2. (5) Point the aircraft heading to the north of the reference. Add coefficient C algebraically to the compass reading and adjust the N-S adjustment screw (coefficient C corrector) to get the correct reading. (6) Point the aircraft heading to the east of the reference. Add coefficient B algebraically to the compass reading and adjust the E-W adjustment screw (coefficient B corrector) to get the correct reading. (7) Turn the aircraft at 45-degree increments; start at the north for aircraft which are not certificated by CAA-Australia. Or turn the aircraft at 30-degree increments; start at the north for aircraft certificated by CAA-Australia. (8) If the deviations between the standby compass and the reference are higher than ÃÂ± 8.0 degrees, do steps 1 to 7 again. (9) Write on the correction card the values shown on the compass and the compensation date. (10) Attach the correction card at the applicable location. (11) Make a simulated condition of electrical emergency as follows: (a) Set the GEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 pushbuttons to the OFF position. Make sure that the related striped bars come on. (b) Lift the guard and push the ESSENTIAL POWER pushbutton to set it to ON. Make sure that: • The striped bar comes on and goes off. • The GEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 striped bars go off. (12) Turn the aircraft at 45-degree increments; start at the north for aircraft which are not certificated by CAA-Australia. Or turn the aircraft at 30-degree increments; start at the north for aircraft certificated by CAA-Australia. (13) Write on the correction card (electrical emergency condition) the values shown on the compass and the compensation date. (14) Attach the correction card (electrical emergency condition) at the applicable location. K. Follow-on   SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Set the GEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 pushbutton switches to the ON position.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Head the aircraft to the North. For this, use average of the readings of the AHRS1 (or IRS 1), shown in the field PRI HDG of the PFD1, and AHRS2 (or IRS2), shown in the field PRI HDG of the PFD2. (c) Compare the two values shown in the field PRI HDG on the REFERENCE DATA page of each PFD. If there is a difference greater than 4.0 degrees between them, this procedure cannot be used to check the standby magnetic compass. (d) Do the procedure that follows for normal condition: 1 Wait some seconds until the standby compass indication becomes stable. 2 Read and write down the reading of the standby compass. 3 Make sure that the difference between the standby compass indication and the aircraft magnetic heading does not exceed ÃÂ± 8.0 degrees, and that the difference between standby compass indication and standby compass correction card (normal condition) does not exceed ÃÂ± 2.0 degrees. If one of the values is not in the tolerances, do the compensation of the standby compass unit ( AMM TASK 34-25-00-700-801-A/500). (e) Do the procedure that follows for electrical emergency condition: 1 Set the GEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 pushbuttons to the OFF position. Make sure that the related striped bars come on. 2 Lift the guard and push the ESSENTIAL POWER pushbutton to set it to ON. Make sure that: • The striped bar comes on and goes off. • The GEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 striped bars go off. 3 Read and write down the reading of the standby compass. 4 Make sure that the difference between the standby compass unit correction- card (electrical emergency) and the standby compass unit indication does not exceed ÃÂ± 2 degrees. If the error is more than ÃÂ± 2 degrees, record the standby compass unit indication. 5 Set the GEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 pushbutton switches to the ON position. Make sure that the related striped bars remain off. 6 Set the ESSENTIAL POWER pushbutton to the AUTO position. Make sure that the striped bar remains off. (f) (Aircraft not certificated by CAA-Australia) Turn the aircraft at 45-degree increments and look at the magnetic heading indication. For this, use average of the readings of the AHRS1 (or IRS 1), shown in the field PRI HDG of the PFD1, and AHRS2 (or IRS2), shown in the field PRI HDG of the PFD2. (g) (Aircraft not certificated by CAA-Australia) Repeat the procedure for normal and electrical emergency conditions for 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270 and 315-degree magnetic headings.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (h) (Aircraft certificated by CAA-Australia) Turn the aircraft at 30-degree increments and look at the magnetic heading indication. For this, use average of the readings of the AHRS1 (or IRS 1), shown in the field PRI HDG of the PFD1, and AHRS2 (or IRS2), shown in the field PRI HDG of the PFD2. (i) (Aircraft certificated by CAA-Australia) Repeat the procedure for normal and electrical emergency conditions for 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, 300 and 330-degree magnetic headings. (j) If the values for normal condition are in the tolerances and the values for electrical emergency condition are out tolerances, do the steps that follow: 1 Stamp the values recorded on a new electrical emergency card. 2 Replace the aircraft electrical emergency card by the new electrical emergency card. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Deenergize the Pitot/Static Sensor Heating System (AMM SDS 30-31-00/1). (2) Deenergize all navigation (AMM SDS 34-00-00/1) and communication services (AMM SDS 23-00-00/1). (3) Stop the engines ( AMM TASK 71-00-01-910-804-A/200). (4) Set the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches to OFF. (5) If the compass rose was used to get the magnetic heading of the aircraft, remove the plumb bobs from each main landing gear (Figure 503). (6) If the landing compass was used get the magnetic heading of the aircraft, remove the landing compass from the tripod and disassemble the tripod.
