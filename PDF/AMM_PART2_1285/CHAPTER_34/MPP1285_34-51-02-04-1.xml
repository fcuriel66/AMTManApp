			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the DME 1 and DME 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (3) Remove the floor panel 231 BF to access the DME 1 antenna and/or remove the floor panel 242BF to access the DME2 antenna (AMM MPP 53-01-02/400) . J. Removal SUBTASK 020-002-A (1) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT DO NOT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET) To remove the DME antenna, do as follows: (Figure 401) (a) Disconnect the coaxial connector (1) from the DME antenna (2). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (b) Use a spatula to remove the sealant from around the fuselage skin hole and the DME antenna (2), on the inner surface of the fuselage skin hole. (c) Use a spatula to remove the sealant from around the DME (2) antenna and aircraft skin (d) Remove the sealant used as protection of the screws (3). (e) Remove the screws (3). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (f) Use a spatula between the baseplate of the DME antenna (2) and the aircraft skin to make the separation. (g) Carefully pull the DME antenna (2) away from the fuselage. (h) Remove the DME antenna (2). (2) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET) To remove the DME antenna, do as follows: (Figure 402) (a) Disconnect the coaxial connector (1) from the DME antenna (2). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (b) Use a spatula to remove the sealant from around the fuselage skin hole and the DME antenna (2), on the inner surface of the fuselage skin hole.
