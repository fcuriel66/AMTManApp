(n) On the two CDUs, push the line select key for GPS1 to show the GPS1 1/4 page. Result: 1 The GPS sensor must show the NAV mode after some time. NOTE: If the GPS unit was not installed and operated recently, it can take up to 30 minutes for the sensor to go from ACQ (acquisition mode ) to NAV mode. This is the time for the system to get the necessary almanac data. There will be no indication that the almanac data is downloaded. If the GPS unit was operated recently, it must show the NAV mode in a few minutes. 2 In the NAV mode, the #SATS field will show how many satellites are received. 3 The INTEG field will show the GPS integrity status and the GPS integrity annunciator must be off, unless ALARM is shown.
