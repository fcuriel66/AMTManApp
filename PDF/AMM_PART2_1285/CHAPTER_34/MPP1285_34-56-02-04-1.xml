(3) Carefully align the gel conductive gasket (3) with the screw holes and antenna connector and install it on the GPS antenna (2) base. (4) Apply the sealant HT3326-5-50 between the bottom of the GPS antenna connector and the internal edge of the gel conductive gasket (3) until you level the surface (SRM 51-20-01). (5) Carefully remove the protective release film with the "AIRCRAFT SIDE" identification from the gel conductive gasket (3). (6) Put the GPS antenna (2) in its installation position.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (8) Use a torque wrench to torque the screws (1) to 1.4 - 1.7 N.m. (12 - 15 lb.in), in a crisscross pattern. (9) Remove one of the screws (1). (10) Do the bonding test (AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/200). NOTE: Use the empty screw hole to get access to the antenna base. (11) Install the screw (1) again and use a torque wrench to torque it to 1.4 - 1.7 N.m. (12 - 15 lb.in). CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY DIFFERENT TYPES OF SEALANTS ON THE SAME REGION. IF YOU DO, THE SEALANT WILL NOT HAVE GOOD ADHESION. THIS CAN CAUSE AN UNWANTED EFFECT ON THE AERODYNAMIC SMOOTHNESS. (12) Apply sealant NAFTOSEAL MC 780 B-1/2 on the contour of the GPS antenna (2), on the aircraft skin (SRM 51-20-01). (13) Apply sealant RTV 780 on the heads of the screws (1) until you fully fill the recesses of the antenna body (SRM 51-20-01). (14) Apply paint 10-P20-44/EC-265/TR114 on the sealant on the heads of the screws (1) (CPM 51-21-05). (15) Remove the protective cap (No ESD) from the coaxial connector (4) and from the connector of the GPS antenna (2). (16) Connect the coaxial connector (4) to the GPS antenna (2). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 940-003-A (1) Remove from the work area all tools, equipment, and materials that you used. CAUTION: DO NOT LET THE WORKSTAND OR OTHER EQUIPMENT TOUCH OR HIT THE AIRCRAFT PARTS. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE CAN OCCUR. (2) Remove the workstand from the work area. SUBTASK 862-003-A (3) For GPS 1 receiver, close GPS 1 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (4) For GPS 2 receiver, close GPS 2 circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. SUBTASK 710-002-A (5) Do the operational test of the GPS as follows: NOTE: • The aircraft must be out of the hangar so that the GPS can receive a satisfactory level of the satellite signal. (a) On the CDU, push the NAV function key to show NAV INDEX page 1/2. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 34-56-02 Page 17 of 18 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
