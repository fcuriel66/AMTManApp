Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION: • BEFORE THE INSTALLATION, MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO UNWANTED MATERIAL IN THE ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORT TO PREVENT THE CONTAMINATION OF THE SYSTEM. • BE CAREFUL AND AVOID TO FORCE OR HANDLE EXCESSIVELY THE WIRES, CABLES AND HARNESS TO GET ACCESS TO THE ANEMOMETRIC PORTS DURING THE REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION ACTIVITIES, BECAUSE DAMAGE TO THE WIRES, CABLES AND HARNESS CAN HAPPEN. (1) With a spatula, remove all the old sealant from the fuselage skin surface where the anemometric static port is installed and from its contour. Prepare these surfaces (SRM 51-20-01). WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE AREA IN THE CIRCLE OF 200 mm IN DIAMETER AROUND THE TWO ANEMOMETRIC STATIC PORTS IS MIRROR-FINISH SKIN (FIGURE 402, DET. B). (2) NOTE: If the access is difficult and you want to connect the hose to the anemometric static port with the port not in its installation position, do steps (7), (8), and (9) before you continue. Make sure that the hose is correctly routed when you install the port. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 34-13-03 Page 9 of 11 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
