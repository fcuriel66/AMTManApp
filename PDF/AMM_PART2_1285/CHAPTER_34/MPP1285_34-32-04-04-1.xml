			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the VOR/ILS1 or VOR/ILS2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (3) Remove the floor panel 231GF to access the Marker Beacon antenna 1 and/or the floor panel 232AF to access the Marker Beacon antenna 2 (AMM MPP 53-01-02/400). J. Removal SUBTASK 020-002-A (1) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT DO NOT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET) To remove the Marker Beacon antenna, do as follows: (Figure 401) (a) Disconnect the coaxial connector (1) from the Marker Beacon antenna (2). CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA.
