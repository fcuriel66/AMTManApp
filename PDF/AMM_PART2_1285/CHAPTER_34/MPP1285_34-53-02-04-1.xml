			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Upper forward fuselage I. Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-002-A NOTE: • Before the application of sealant PR1826 B1/4 it is necessary to apply the PR1826 Adhesion Promoter on the surface where the sealant will be applied. Let the Adhesion Promoter dry for 30 minutes minimum. • Sealant PR1826 B1/4 must be applied in less than 8 hours from the application of the adhesion promoter. • The curing time of sealant PR1826 B1/4 is 1.5 hours at 25ÃÂ°C (77ÃÂ°F). • For more information about sealant PR1826 B1/4, refer to AMM MPP 20-30-03/200. (1) To install the ADF antenna with a gasket, do these steps (Figure 401): (a) Remove all the old sealant from the upper fuselage skin surface where the ADF antenna is installed. For this, use a plastic spatula. (b) Clean the surface with a cloth wet with methyl-ethyl-ketone solvent, specification ASTM-D740; then rub the surface with a clean lint-free cloth before the solvent evaporates. (c) Install the antenna gasket (2). (d) Put the antenna (1) in position on the skin. (e) Wet the screws (4) and (5) with sealant PR1826 B1/4. CAUTION:APPLY THE TORQUE VALUE CORRECTLY. INCORRECT INSTALLATION WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS TO THE AIRCRAFT. (f) NOTE: If you must replace the screws (4) or (5), make sure that the new screws obey the specified length accurately (IPC 34-53-02). Tighten the screws (4) and (5). Obey a crisscross pattern. (g) Apply sealant PR1826 B1/4 along the contour of the antenna base. (h) Apply the sealant PR1826 B1/4 or sealant RTV 732 to the contour of the antenna connector. (i) From the inside of the aircraft, connect the electrical connector (3) to the antenna (1). (2) To install the ADF antenna with sealant (Ultra Seal Conductive Antenna Gasket Kit), do these steps (Figure 402): EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 34-53-02 Page 7 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

(b) Clean the surface with a cloth wet with methyl-ethyl-ketone solvent, specification ASTM-D740; then rub the surface with a clean lint-free cloth before the solvent evaporates. (c) Put the antenna (1) in position on the skin and use adhesive tape to mask the area around the antenna. (d) Remove the antenna (1). (e) On the upper fuselage skin surface, cover the holes of the screws and the connector to prevent leakage of the sealant through them. (f) Mix all A and B parts of the Ultra Seal Conductive Antenna Gasket Kit (IPC 34-53-02) for 5 minutes. NOTE: The Ultra Seal Conductive Antenna Gasket part numbers 540685-3 and 540685-4 are the same product, only the quantity is different. (g) Apply the sealant (Ultra Seal Conductive Antenna Gasket Kit) evenly in the area marked in step (c). NOTE: • Apply the sealant in less than 40 minutes from the mixture of its parts A and B. • Do not apply sealant on the covered holes of the screws and the connector. (h) Evenly apply the aluminum balls (3) to the sealant (2). (i) Remove the protections that cover the holes of the screws and the connector. (j) Remove and discard the adhesive tape. (k) Put the antenna (1) in position on the skin. (l) Wet the screws (5) and (6) with sealant PR1826 B1/4. CAUTION:APPLY THE TORQUE VALUE CORRECTLY. INCORRECT INSTALLATION WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS TO THE AIRCRAFT. (m) NOTE: If you must replace the screws (5) or (6), make sure that the new screws obey the specified length accurately (IPC 34-53-02). Tighten the screws (5) and (6). Obey a crisscross pattern. (n) Remove the unwanted sealant with a plastic spatula. (o) Clean the surface with a cloth wet with methyl-ethyl-ketone solvent, specification ASTM-D740; then rub the surface with a clean lint-free cloth before the solvent evaporates. (p) Apply sealant PR1826 B1/4 along the contour of the antenna base. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 34-53-02 Page 8 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
