(6) On the circuit breaker panel, open the AHRS 1 (Location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/NAV/AHRS 1) or AHRS 2 (Location tip: DC BUS 2/NAV/AHRS 2) circuit breaker. (7) On the ELECTRICAL panel, on the overhead panel, push the BACKUP pushbutton (striped bar comes on). J. Configuration (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 860-002-A (1) On GSE 135, set the rotary selector to the position related to the AHRS to be configured (AHRS 1 or AHRS 2). (2) On GSE 135, turn the memory access switch of the related AHRS to the ON position (ground). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the AHRS 1 (Location tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/NAV/AHRS 1) or AHRS 2 (Location tip: DC BUS 2/NAV/AHRS 2) circuit breaker. (4) Energize the PC. NOTE: (AHRS Configuration Software DOS version) The MS-DOS mode is necessary for the AHRS Configuration Software DOS version to operate. Select: "Restart the computer in the MS-DOS mode" (do not use the MS-DOS prompt icon of the Windows Desktop). (5) Wait for the AHRS to complete the alignment procedure. (6) Start the AHRS Configuration Software. (a) (AHRS Configuration Software DOS version) Go to the directory where the AHRS Configuration Software is installed.
