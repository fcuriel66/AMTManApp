(3) (Aircraft with AHRS AH-800) Make sure that the aircraft is in the on-ground configuration. (4) (Aircraft with AHRS AH-900) Make sure that the indicated groundspeed on the PFD is lower than 20 knots. (5) Make sure that the AHRS1 and AHRS2 circuit breakers, on the circuit breaker panel, are closed. J. Operational Check of the AHRS (Figure 502)   (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-012-A (1) (Aircraft with AHRS AH-900) Do the alignment of the AHRS as follows: (a) NOTE: • The AHRS must receive the present position for the alignment to be completed. The FMS position must be updated to permit this data to be read by the AHRS. • If the aircraft is moved during the alignment, the AHRU stops the alignment and starts a full alignment again 30 seconds after the motion stops. (Aircraft with FMS Honeywell) Do the FMS position update as follows: 1 On the FMS CDU1, push the NAV mode key and the NEXT function key. – The NAV INDEX 2/2 page is shown. 2 Push the POS INIT (3L) left line select key. – The POS INIT 1/1 page is shown. 3 Push the LOAD (2R) right line select key to update the FMS position with the last saved position. – The FMS CDU shows the LOADED POSITION coordinates. (b) (Aircraft with FMS Universal) On the INIT 1/1 page, on FMS CDU1, push the ACCEPT line select key to update the FMS position. (c) Wait until the alignment is completed. The alignment time depends on the local latitude. The time of alignment is about 5 minutes at zero degree of latitude, 10 minutes at ÃÂ± 60 degrees of latitude, up to 17 minutes from ÃÂ± 70.24 to ÃÂ± 78.25 degrees of latitude. • After the alignment of the AHRS is completed, the flags ATT FAIL and HDG FAIL go out of PFD1 and MFD1, and a valid attitude and heading data are shown.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (15) Make sure that the AHRU1 pitch and roll outputs shown on the PFD1 are within (0 ÃÂ± 0.1) degree. If not, use the indicated error to determine the proper pitch and roll leveling to be made to the AHRU1 Mounting Tray. Do the leveling of the AHRU1 Mounting Tray again until a satisfactory result is achieved. (16) Do steps (1) to (15) again for AHRU2 with FMS CDU2, PFD2 and MFD2. K. Alignment of the AHRU Mounting Tray (Figure 504)  SUBTASK 710-015-A NOTE: The steps below describe the alignment of AHRU1 Mounting Tray. For alignment of AHRU2 Mounting Tray, use AHRS2, FMS CDU 2, MFD2, PFD2 instead of AHRS1, FMS CDU 1, MFD1, PFD1 (1) Note the angle of the true heading of the reference line (H ), in relation to the true T north. (2) Make sure that the aircraft is level. (3) Put plumb bobs at points 1 (Zone 123 and Zone 124) and 9 (Zone 311 and Zone 312) under the fuselage of the aircraft along the longitudinal axis to determine the true heading of the aircraft (H ). A NOTE: The plumb bob must not touch the ground, but it must be as near as possible. (4) Wait the plumb bob to stabilize and, after that, mark the projection of its tip on a piece of adhesive tape put on the ground. (5) Determine the distances L, D , and D , with a tape measure (Figure 504). 1 2 • Where: L = Length of aircraft between plumb bobs (in. or mm). L is always positive. D = Displacement of the plumb bob at the front of the aircraft (in. or mm). D is 1 1 positive if the plumb bob is at the right of the reference line, when you look from the rear to the nose of the aircraft. D = Displacement of the plumb bob at the rear of the aircraft (in. or mm). D is 2 2 positive if the plumb bob is at the left of the reference line, when you look from the rear to the nose of the aircraft. NOTE: • D and D must be perpendicular to the reference line (true north or 1 2 known true heading). • D and D must be measured with an accuracy of 1mm (or 1/8 in.). 1 2 (6) Use this equation to determine the true heading of the aircraft (H ): A -1 H = H + Sin [(D + D )/L] degrees A T 1 2 – Where: H = True heading of the aircraft (in decimal degrees).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H = True heading of the surveyed line (in decimal degrees). T (7) Make sure that the aircraft is in the on-ground configuration and the indicated airspeed on the PFD1 is lower than 20 knots. (8) On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that the AHRS1 circuit breaker is closed. (9) Make sure that the FMS CDU 1 is operational and on. (10) Do the steps below to get the heading data from the AHRU1: (a) Make sure that PFD1 shows red flags ATT FAIL and HDG FAIL. (b) Make sure that MFD1 shows a red flag HDG FAIL. (c) NOTE: • The AHRS must receive the present position for the alignment to be completed. The FMS position must be updated to permit this data to be read by the AHRS. • If the aircraft is moved during the alignment, the AHRU stops the alignment and starts a full alignment again 30 seconds after the motion stops. (Aircraft with FMS Honeywell) Do the FMS position update as follows: 1 On the FMS CDU1, push the NAV mode key and the NEXT function key. – The NAV INDEX 2/2 page is shown. 2 Push the POS INIT (3L) left line select key. – The POS INIT 1/1 page is shown. 3 Push the LOAD (2R) right line select key to update the FMS position with the last saved position. – The FMS CDU shows the LOADED POSITION coordinates. (d) (Aircraft with FMS Universal) On the INIT 1/1 page, on FMS CDU1, push the ACCEPT line select key to update the FMS position. (e) Wait until the alignment is completed. The alignment time depends on the local latitude. The time of alignment is about 5 minutes at zero degree of latitude, 10 minutes at ÃÂ± 60 degrees of latitude, up to 17 minutes from ÃÂ± 70.24 to ÃÂ± 78.25 degrees of latitude. • After the alignment of the AHRS is completed, the flags ATT FAIL and HDG FAIL go out of PFD1 and MFD1, and a valid attitude and heading data are shown. (11) Do the steps below to enter the Maintenance Test Mode on the PFD1: (a) On the DC-550, select the decision height knob for 690 on the PFD. (b) Push and hold the TEST button on the DC-550 for approximately 5 to 7 seconds. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-804-A/500 34-21-00 Page 16 of 24 Rev 49 - Feb  16/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) While you hold the TEST button, push the ET button on the DC-550. (d) Release the TEST button. • The REFERENCE DATA page is shown on PFD1. • The PRI TRU HDG line shows the true heading value in cyan, followed by a green "V". NOTE: • The true heading value is displayed in degrees from 0.0 to 359.9. • The IC-600 should now be in the maintenance test mode and will remain in test (via software) until it is canceled by another press of the TEST button or selecting a RA setting bellow 600. (12) Compare the AHRU1 true heading displayed at the field PRI TRUE HDG on the REFERENCE DATA page with the true heading calculated in the step (6). (a) If the difference is not within the desired accuracy (ÃÂ± 0.2 degree), adjust the AHRU mounting tray yaw as necessary. (13) Tighten the two aft bolts of AHRU1 Mounting Tray and make sure that the true heading indication on the REFERENCE DATA page, on PFD1, continues within the tolerance. (14) On the circuit breaker panel, open the AHRS1 circuit breaker. (15) Remove the AHRU1 (AMM TASK 34-21-01-000-801-A/400) and tighten the two forward screws of the AHRU1 Mounting Tray. NOTE: Do this step carefully so as not to losing the adjustment of the AHRU Mounting Tray. (16) Use the torque wrench to torque the four bolts that attach AHRU Mounting Tray to the aircraft structure to 2.8 N.m (25 lb.in) in a crisscross pattern. (17) Install AHRU1 in its mounting tray again ( AMM TASK 34-21-01-400-801-A/400). (18) On the circuit breaker panel, close the AHRS1 circuit breaker. (19) Do steps (10) to (12) again and make sure that the true heading indication (PRI TRU HDG) on the REFERENCE DATA page, on PFD1, continues within the tolerance. L. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-011-A (1) Do the procedure AMM TASK 32-63-00-860-801-A/200 to put the aircraft to initial condition. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the IND 1, IND 2, AWS 1 and AWS 2 circuit breakers. (3) Close access door 113CZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (4) (POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036) Remove the safety pin from the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200).
