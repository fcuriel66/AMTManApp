			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Lightning Sensor System - Test Procedures SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Do the operational test of the lightning sensor system as follows: (a) On the weather radar controller, set the LSS select key to the CLR/TST position. Result: 1 After 3 to 4 seconds, a rate 3 symbol is shown at 25 NM and 45 degrees right. This cell will build up in approximately 5 to 7 seconds. NOTE: This Time will be extended by approximately 15 seconds if TEST is set immediately from OFF, due to the processor initialization. The symbol range can change by as much as 5 NM if there is a strong local interference. The test symbol will degrade and vanish after approximately 2 minutes. 2 An ALERT symbol is shown at the maximum select range, at 45 degrees right. This will stay for 3 - 7 seconds. Some indicators do not give information at 45 degrees at the maximum selected range. (b) (POST-MOD S.B.145-34-0057). On the weather radar controller, set the LSS switch to the OFF position. Result: 1 A green LX/OFF annunciation is shown on the bottom left corner of the MFD. (c) Rotate the LSS switch to STBY. Result: 1 A green STBY annunciation is displayed on the MFD. NOTE: An LX/C (green) tells that the system is in the self-calibration mode. This will revert to the select mode approximately 10 seconds after the power starts. (d) Turn the LSS switch to LX. Result: 1 In normal operation, a green LX is shown on the MFD. An amber LX is the indication of LSS interface failure. NOTE: An LX/F (amber) tells that the system self-test detected a failure. (e) On the circuit breaker panel, open the following circuit breakers: • (Aircraft with Dual IRS) IRS 1 and IRS 2. • (Aircraft with AHRS) AHRS1 and AHRS 2. On the backup relay box, open the following circuit breakers: • (Aircraft with Dual IRS) IRS 1 and IRS 2. • (Aircraft with AHRS) AHRS 1 and AHRS 2. Result: 1 An LX/H (green), shown on the MFD, tells that the heading input was deselected or invalid. (f) Turn the LSS switch to CLR/TST.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 An LX/CL (green) tells that the system is in the clear mode. This occurs for approximately 3 seconds after the CLR/TST mode was selected. After this time, the mode annunciation changes to LX/T (green). (g) (Aircraft with HF system) On the Pilot's or on the Copilot's Digital Audio Panel, push the HF switch, then on the Pilot or Copilot control wheel, push the PTT switch. Result: 1 An LX/I (green) tells that the receiver is inhibited during the HF communication transmissions. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the circuit breaker panel, close the following circuit breakers: • (Aircraft with Dual IRS) IRS 1 and IRS 2. • (Aircraft with AHRS) AHRS1 and AHRS 2. (2) On the backup relay box, open the following circuit breakers: • (Aircraft with Dual IRS) IRS 1 and IRS 2. • (Aircraft with AHRS) AHRS 1 and AHRS 2. (3) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 34-44-00 Page 4 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
