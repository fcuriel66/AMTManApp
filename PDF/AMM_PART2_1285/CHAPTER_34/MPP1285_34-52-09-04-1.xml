			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Forward electronic compartment. I. Installation (Figure 402)  (Figure 403)   (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION: • DAMAGE TO THE COM UNIT STRAP-BOARD ASSEMBLY FROM ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE CAN OCCUR. GROUND YOURSELF BEFORE YOU TOUCH THE COM UNIT STRAP-BOARD ASSEMBLY. ALWAYS TOUCH IT BY THE EDGES. • CAREFULLY CUT THE JUMPER WIRES (STRAPS) WITH THE AID OF SHARPEN CUTTER PLIERS TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE COM UNIT STRAP-BOARD ASSEMBLY. (1) NOTE: If you cut the incorrect jumper wire (strap) (1), refer to Wiring Manual (WM 20-30-00) to repair the strap board. If necessary, configure the COM Unit Strap-Board Assembly (2). Refer to the Wiring Manual (WM 34-90-01 or WM 34-90-02 or WM 34-90-03 as applicable to the related aircraft serial number). If the Wiring Manual does not have the Mode-S address code applicable to your aircraft serial number, do as follows: NOTE: The Mode-S Transponder module has one 24-bit code (Mode-S address in binary) for each aircraft. If you do not have the Mode-S address code, tell the aviation authority of the country in which the aircraft is registered to give you the Mode-S address code. The Mode-S address code can be supplied in an octal or binary or hexadecimal mode. (a) If you received the Mode-S address code in octal or hexadecimal mode, convert the octal or hexadecimal code into a binary number (24-bit). 1 Example: Conversion from octal to binary mode. Octal address code = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 The octal number converted to binary number is: 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 000. Table 401 Code in Octal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 Code in Binary 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 000 2 Example: Conversion from hexadecimal to binary mode. Hexadecimal address code = 2 9 C B B 8. The hexadecimal number converted into binary number is: 0010 1001 1100 1011 1011 1000. Table 402 Code in Hexadecimal 2 9 C B B 8 EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 34-52-09 Page 6 of 11 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Table 402 (Continued) Code in Binary 0010 1001 1100 1011 1011 1000 (b) (AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD SB 145-34-0118) After the code is converted into binary number, write the binary code in Mode-S address-code configuration table (3) for the jumpers (most significant bit - MSB) W32 to (least significant bit - LSB) W9. Refer to Figure 402. (c) (AIRCRAFT POST-MOD SB 145-34-0118) After the code is converted into binary number, write the binary code in Mode-S address-code configuration table (3) for the jumpers (most significant bit - MSB) W32 to (least significant bit - LSB) W9. Refer to Figure 403. CAUTION: Before you cut the jumper wires (straps) (1) on the COM unit strap board (2), make the Mode-S address-code configuration in the Mode-S address code configuration table (3) . Thus, you will not cut the incorrect jumper wires (straps) (1). (d) On the code converted, on a piece of paper, configure the jumpers (straps) from W32 to W9, filling the spaces that mean bit equal to "1". You can use the Mode-S configuration table (3) to help you. NOTE: Each binary 0 represents a grounded (not cut = blank space) strap and 1 represents an open strap (cut = filled space). CAUTION: CUT THE JUMPER WIRES (STRAPS) (1) CAREFULLY TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE CIRCUIT BOARD. (e) To configure the COM unit strap board (2), cut the jumper wires that represent the Bit "1" (filled space) in the Mode-S address-code configuration table (3). Use sharp cutter pliers to cut the jumper wires (straps) (1). CAUTION: DO NOT CUT JUMPER WIRES (STRAPS) W3 AND W4 NOW BECAUSE THESE JUMPER WIRES (STRAPS) WILL BE CUT FOR PARITY BIT. (f) (AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD SB 145-34-0118) Configure (cut) jumper wires (straps) W1, W2, W5 thru W8, and W33 thru W50 as configured before in the old COM unit strap board. Or you can configure (cut) them as given in WM 34-90-01 or WM 34-90-02 or WM 34-90-03, as applicable to your aircraft serial number. Refer to Figure 402. CAUTION: DO NOT CUT JUMPER WIRES (STRAPS) W3 AND W4 NOW BECAUSE THESE JUMPER WIRES (STRAPS) WILL BE CUT FOR PARITY BIT. (g) (AIRCRAFT POST-MOD SB 145-34-0118) Configure (cut) jumper wires (straps) W1, W2, W5 thru W8, and W33 thru W66 as configured before in the old COM unit strap board. Refer to Figure 403. NOTE: Jumper wires (straps) W67 thru W72 are spare straps and must not be configured (do not cut them). (h) (AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD SB 145-34-0118) After all other straps are configured, configure the strap for parity bit as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 34-52-09 Page 7 of 11 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: • Do not consider jumper wires (straps) W3, W4, and W49 to W50 for the parity bit configuration. • The parity straps (W3 or W4) are used to make sure that the straps data is valid. For you to have correct parity, cut jumper wire (strap) W3 or jumper wire (strap) W4, but do not cut the two of them. 1 Count the number of binary 0 (grounded = not cut = blank space) straps in positions W1, W2, and W5 thru W48. a If the number of binary 0 (grounded = not cut = blank space) is EVEN, cut jumper wire (strap) W3. b If the number of binary 0 (grounded = not cut = blank space) is ODD, cut jumper wire (strap) W4. (i) (AIRCRAFT POST-MOD SB 145-34-0118) After all other straps are configured, configure the strap for parity bit as follows: NOTE: • Do not consider jumper wires (straps) W3 and W4 for the parity bit configuration. • The parity straps (W3 or W4) are used to make sure that the straps data is valid. For you to have correct parity, cut jumper wire (strap) W3 or jumper wire (strap) W4, but do not cut the two of them. 1 Count the number of binary 0 (grounded = not cut = blank space) straps in positions W1, W2, and W5 thru W72. a If the number of binary 0 (grounded = not cut = blank space) is EVEN, cut jumper wire (strap) W3. b If the number of binary 0 (grounded = not cut = blank space) is ODD, cut jumper wire (strap) W4. (2) Carefully connect the flat connector (1) to the COM Unit Strap-Board Assembly (2). (3) Put the COM Unit Strap-Board Assembly (2) in position. (4) Put the acrylic cover (3) in position. (5) (AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD SB 145-34-0118) Install the screws (4), lock washers (5), and washers (6) which attach the COM Unit Strap-Board Assembly (2) to the mounting tray. (6) (AIRCRAFT POST-MOD SB 145-34-0118) Install the screws (4), lock washers (5), washers (6) and posts (7) which attach the COM Unit Strap-Board Assembly (2) to the mounting tray. (7) (AIRCRAFT POST-MOD SB 145-34-0118) Torque the posts (7) and screws (4) to 0.23 - 0.34 N.m (2.0 - 3.0 lb.in). Refer to Figure 401.
