Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE Center fuselage II ( for RA1) or Rear fuse- 1 Does the task lage I (for RA2) I. Installation SUBTASK 420-012-B (1) Make sure that the aircraft is in the same configuration as it was at the end of the removal (AMM TASK 34-31-02-000-801-A/400). (2) Examine and clean or replace the coaxial connector (1) as required (WM 20-50-00/201). (3) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT DO NOT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET). To install the radio altimeter antenna, do as follows: (Figure 403) EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 CONFIG-1 34-31-02 Page 18 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK). PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES, PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE GAS. DO THE WORK IN AN AREA WHICH HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK) IS POISONOUS AND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. (a) With a clean cloth soaked in Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), clean the antenna base surface. CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL BONDING GIVES A GOOD ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVE PATH. IF NOT, DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (b) Do the bonding procedure, method 12, on the antenna installation surface on the aircraft skin (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200). CAUTION: INSTALL THE ANTENNAS WITH ARROWS HEAD ON, ONE IN THE FLIGHT DIRECTION AND THE OTHER ONE OPPOSITE TO THE FLIGHT DIRECTION. (c) Put the radio altimeter antenna (3) in installation position. (d) Install the screws (2). (e) Use a torque wrench to torque the screws (2) to 2.8 N.m. (25 lb.in) in a crisscross pattern. (f) Do the bonding test between the connector of the radio altimeter antenna (3) and aircraft ground (AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/200). (g) Apply aerodynamic sealant P/S870 B-2 around the contour of the radio altimeter antenna (3), on the skin (SRM 51-20-01). (h) Apply sealant 780 (WHITE) on the screw heads until you fully fill the recesses in the antenna body (SRM 51-20-01). (i) Apply sealant PR1422 B-2 around the fuselage skin hole and the radio altimeter antenna base, on the inner surface of the fuselage skin (SRM 51-20-01). (j) Fill the internal part of the coaxial connector (1) and its mate with Dow Corning No. 4 Lubricant Compound (WM 20-50-00/201). CAUTION: LOOK AT THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COAXIAL CONNECTORS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE THE CORRECT CONNECTIONS. INCORRECT CONNECTIONS CAN CAUSE MALFUNCTION OF THE SYSTEM OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPONENT. (k) Connect the coaxial connector (1) to the radio altimeter antenna (3). (4) (AIRCRAFT WITH ANTENNAS THAT HAVE GEL CONDUCTIVE GASKET). To install the radio altimeter antenna, do as follows: (Figure 404) EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 CONFIG-1 34-31-02 Page 19 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK). PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES, PROTECTIVE GLOVES AND CLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE GAS. DO THE WORK IN AN AREA WHICH HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK) IS POISONOUS AND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. (a) With a clean cloth soaked in Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), clean the antenna base surface. (b) Carefully remove the protective release film from the gel conductive gasket (4). (c) Carefully remove the protective release film identified with "ANTENNA SIDE" from the gel conductive gasket (4). (d) Carefully align the gel conductive gasket (4) with the screw holes and connector, and install it to the base of the radio altimeter antenna (3). (e) Carefully remove the protective release film from the gel conductive gasket (4). (f) Carefully remove the protective release film identified with "AIRCRAFT SIDE" from the gel conductive gasket (4). CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL BONDING GIVES A GOOD ELECTRIC CONDUCTIVE PATH. IF NOT, DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (g) Do the bonding procedure, method 12, on the antenna installation surface on the aircraft skin (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200).

(i) Install the screws (2). (j) Use a torque wrench to torque the screws (2) to 2.8 N.m. (25 lb.in) in a crisscross pattern. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE POLYETHYLENE SPATULA TO BREAK THE ANTENNA SEAL. TOO MUCH FORCE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SKIN, THE COAXIAL CABLE, OR THE ANTENNA. (k) With a spatula, remove the excess gel of the conductive gel gasket (4) from around the radio altimeter antenna (3) and from the aircraft skin. (l) Do the bonding test between the connector of the radio altimeter antenna (3) and aircraft ground (AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/200). (m) Apply aerodynamic sealant P/S870 B-2 around the contour of the radio altimeter antenna (3), on the skin (SRM 51-20-01). (n) Apply paint ECL-G-46/PC-233/TR109 on the screw (2) heads (CPM 51-21-06). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-802-A/400 CONFIG-1 34-31-02 Page 20 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
