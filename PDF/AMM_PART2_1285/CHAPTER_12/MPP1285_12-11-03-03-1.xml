			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL FUEL TANK DRAINING - SERVICING EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to drain the fuel tanks. B. The fuel tanks are drained through the drain valves installed at the lowest part of the inboard tanks. C. You must drain the fuel tanks periodically to remove free water and other types of contamination that come with the fuel and stay in the lowest part of the tanks. D. In cold weather drain the fuel tanks if the aircraft will be parked for more than 45 minutes E. The fuel lines are drained through drain valves installed in the crossfeed line, pressure fueling lines, and ventilation fuel lines. These fuel lines are drained for servicing and maintenance only. F. Refer to AMM MPP 28-11-00/700 for control, prevention, and treatment of corrosion caused by microorganisms. G. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 12-11-03-600-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. FUEL TANK DRAINING - SERVICING A. General (1) Drain fuel from each tank and examine it for water and other unwanted matter. You will usually see the water as a layer below the fuel or as small bubbles on the fuel. (2) Let the water go down apart from the fuel before you drain it. NOTE: It is recommended to let aircraft be stable (aircraft parked and fuel not being used) for approximately 1.5 hours. This procedure is necessary to let the water go to the bottom of the tank. B.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Open access panel 192CL or 192DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (2) Open access panel 192HL or 192JR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) (LR/LU/KL versions). J. Drain Fuel Tanks to Check for the Presence of Water (Figure 301)  SUBTASK 680-002-A WARNING: • BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 28-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO YOU AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL. • BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET FUEL GET INTO YOUR EYES OR INTO YOUR SKIN. FUEL CAN FALL OFF THE DRAIN VALVE SUDDENLY. • IF YOU MUST DO TASKS WITH A HEATING GUN, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN WM 20-10-00. EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR IF YOU USE AN UNQUALIFIED HEATING GUN NEAR HAZARDOUS LOCATIONS. CAUTION: • IN COLD WEATHER, THE WATER CAN FREEZE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FUEL TANKS. IF APPLICABLE, BEFORE YOU DRAIN THE FUEL TANKS, APPLY HEAT TO THIS AREA. REFER TO STEP (1). • THE HOT AIR TEMPERATURE FROM THE HEATING GUN MUST NOT BE MORE THAN 50ÃÂ°C. TEMPERATURES ABOVE 50ÃÂ°C CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS. (1) For cold weather, do the following step: • With the aid of a heating gun, apply heat in the draining areas of the tanks, until all the ice is melted. To make sure that all the ice is melted, frequently do a check to know if the fuel flow comes from the drain valves. (2) Put the draining device with the transparent flask below the drain valve. CAUTION: TO OPEN THE DRAIN VALVE, DO NOT TURN THE DRAINING DEVICE CLOCKWISE. IT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE DRAIN VALVE. (3) Open the drain valve with the draining device. To do this, push the draining device and give it a one-quarter turn counterclockwise. NOTE: • Drain many times, until the fuel in the container is with no water.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • For cold weather, do the heating procedure again to make sure that all ice is melted, if applicable. • Examine the collected fuel for contamination, especially at the fuel/water interface. (4) If, during consecutive drainings, the presence of sediments or sludge, or water in solution in the fuel is noticed, do the Periodical Analysis for Presence of Microorganisms in the Tanks ( AMM TASK 28-11-00-300-803-A/700). (5) When the procedure is completed, close the drain valve. To do this, give it one-quarter turn in the opposite direction. (6) Do steps (1), (2), and (3) and (4) again for the other tank drain valve. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close access panel 192CL or 192DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (2) Close access panel 192HL or 192JR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) (LR/LU/KL versions). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 600-801-A/300 12-11-03 Page 4 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
