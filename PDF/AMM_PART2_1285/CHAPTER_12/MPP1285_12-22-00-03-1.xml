Light Dirt Removal (Figure 301)  SUBTASK 610-002-A (1) To clean the aircraft, using the wet wash procedure do as follows: CAUTION: DO NOT DRY-CLEAN DUST FROM PAINTING OR ACRYLIC PARTS (PASSENGER WINDOWS, WING-TO-FUSELAGE FAIRING, WING LIGHTS, ETC.) NOT TO CAUSE SCRATCHES TO THEM. (a) Prepare the cleaning solution in a dilution ratio of 10% in volume of detergent to one liter of water. CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY SOLUTION IN LARGE AREAS WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY CLEANED BEFORE THE SOLUTION DRIES ON THE SURFACE. STAINS CAN OCCUR, IF THE SOLUTION DRIES ON THE SURFACE. (b) Apply the cleaning solution with a spray gun or a soft-bristle sweeping brush or equivalent equipment. (c) Let the cleaning solution soak into the surface for a sufficient time for the dirt to become soft (about 5 minutes). CAUTION: • DO NOT USE HIGH PRESSURE (MAXIMUM 70 PSI) AND DO NOT POINT THE FLOW OF WATER DIRECTLY TO THE ANGLE-OF- ATTACK SENSORS (AOA) (AMM SDS 27-36-00/1) OR OTHER MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL OR HYDRAULIC COMPONENTS. LIQUIDS THAT GET INTO THESE AREAS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE. • KEEP THE NOZZLE OF THE SPRAY EQUIPMENT MORE THAN 304 mm (12 in) AWAY FROM THE SURFACE OF THE AIRPLANE. THE SPRAY CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE SURFACE. (d) Fully flush with clean water, three or more times. Finally flush the surface from its top down to the bottom. Make sure that the solution is fully removed. NOTE: If necessary, apply solution again and rub with a soft-bristle sweeping brush, a rag, or a soft-bristle brush to help you remove the dirt. (e) Dry with forced air or dry rags. (2) To clean the aircraft, using the wet wash procedure using the ATG-401 do as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 600-801-A/300 12-22-00 Page 4 of 15 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
