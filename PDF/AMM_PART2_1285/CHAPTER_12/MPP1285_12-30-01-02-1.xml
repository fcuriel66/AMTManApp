			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 12-30-01-860-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. DEICING/ANTI-ICING FLUID APPLICATION A. General (1) These procedures give the methods for the deicing and anti-icing of the aircraft on the ground for a safe takeoff and flight. (2) When the aircraft surfaces contain frozen moisture, they must be deiced before the aircraft is dispatched. When there is freezing precipitation and the precipitation adheres to the surfaces at the time of dispatch, the aircraft must be deiced/anti-iced. (3) Deicing/anti-icing will prevent a large quantity of snow or ice accretion on the aircraft and surfaces. Ice accretion on the wing and flight control surfaces affects airflow over the affected surface, and can create lift or flight control problems for aircraft and affect flight safety. Ice accretion on the leading edge of engine inlets causes flow problems and can lead to ice ingestion. (4) If deicing and anti-icing are necessary, the procedure can be done in one or two steps. For the selection of the more correct method, you must know see the conditions that you have: weather conditions, available equipment, available fluids, and the holdover time. (5) Deicing is a procedure by which frost, ice, slush, or snow is removed from the aircraft to clean the surfaces. (6) Anti-icing is a procedure which prevents the formation of frost or ice and accumulation of snow or slush on the surfaces of the aircraft for a limited period of time (holdover time). NOTE: Holdover time is the estimated time during which the anti-icing fluid will prevent the formation of frozen contamination on the protected surfaces of an aircraft. (7) These methods below are available: (a) Deicing/anti-icing fluid application. It can be done in one or two steps. 1 One-step deicing/anti-icing may be done with an anti-icing fluid. The fluid used to deice the aircraft stays on the aircraft surfaces to give a limited anti-icing capability. NOTE: The procedure is usually done when the precipitation is not continuous and the anti−icing protection is only necessary for a short time. 2 Two-step deicing/anti-icing includes deicing followed by anti-icing, as a separate fluid application. Anti-icing fluid is applied to protect the surfaces. It gives the maximum possible anti-icing capability. NOTE: Do this procedure when the precipitation condition is continuous and the anti-icing protection is necessary for a longer time. Do the two-step procedure as follows: a Use a heated mixture of deicing/anti-icing fluid and water or heated water to eliminate ice, snow, slush or frost from the aircraft surfaces.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Removal of snow and ice by manual methods. NOTE: • The deicing/anti-icing procedure must always be done by trained and qualified persons. • Heavy quantity of snow will be difficult to remove from the aircraft surfaces and large quantities of fluid will be constantly consumed in the use. Under these conditions, take into consideration that you can remove the volume of the snow mechanically before you try to do a normal deicing procedure. (c) Removal of snow (that does not adhere to the surface) with forced air. 1 Forced air uses an air stream to remove accumulations of frozen contamination from the aircraft with or without fluid. Forced air could provide the option of injecting heated or unheated fluid into the air stream for removal of heavier frozen contamination. NOTE: • Forced air only can not remove adhering contaminants and therefore will not eliminate the need for deicing processes • Forced air or forced air/fluid applications can not eliminate the need for deicing/anti-icing processes. • Forced air systems could also assist in the application of anti-icing fluids when approved by the fluid manufacturer. • Forced air can be heated or ambient temperature can be used. (8) For these procedures, one of these fluids must be used: • Unheated/heated water. • Type I deicing fluid. • Type II deicing/anti-icing fluid. • Type III deicing/anti-icing fluid. • Type IV deicing/anti-icing fluid. • Tiolon A-20 - Anti-icing for door seals. NOTE: • Use only type I fluid as given in the SAE AMS 1424 specification. The use of Alkali Organic Salt-based fluid is not recommended. • Use only type II, type III and type IV fluids as given in the SAE AMS 1428 specification. • Refer to the fluid manufacturer's specifications for fluid mixture, if applicable, and holdover times. • The performance characteristics of SAE Type II, Type III and IV deicing/anti- icing fluids may be degraded by excessive mechanical shearing or chemical contamination.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL application devices must be used. The design of fluid transfer systems must be as given in the fluid manufacturers' recommendations. • SAE Type II, Type III and IV deicing/anti-icing fluids, if heated, must be heated in a manner to preclude fluid degradation in storage or application. The integrity of the fluid after heating must be checked periodically. Factors like heating rate and heating time cycles must be considered while you determine the frequency of fluid inspections. Refer to fluid manufacturer's recommendations. (9) The decision on the best method to do the tasks in this section must agree with each operator's experience, equipment and materials available, and local conditions.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Guidelines (1) You must regularly remove the snow from a parked aircraft. This will prevent a large quantity of snow and ice accretion on the aircraft. This practice also minimizes the possibility of ice accretion on the aircraft surfaces.   (a) To find the quantity of deicing/anti-icing fluid to use in the deicing mixture at a given temperature, refer to the airline procedure or the manufacturer's specifications for the fluid that you use. (b) Use hot water or heated deicing fluid for best results in ice, frost, or snow removal. A fine-to-medium spray is recommended for best dispersion of the fluid across a large area of ice, frost, or snow for maximum melting. (c) Refer to the manufacturer's specification for the deicing fluid dilution versus the temperature measured. The lower of the ambient temperature or aircraft surface temperature must be used as the reference temperature. If the melted ice or snow, mixed with deicing fluid, freezes again on the aircraft as it runs off, it shows that a larger concentration of deicing fluid is necessary. WARNING: DO NOT APPLY TYPE II, III OR IV FLUID MANY TIMES WITHOUT SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF SAE AMS 1424 TYPE I FLUID OR HOT WATER. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, RESIDUES CAN COLLECT IN AERODYNAMICALLY QUIET AREAS, CAVITIES, AND GAPS. THE RESIDUES CAN BECOME A LIQUID AGAIN AND FREEZE UNDER CERTAIN TEMPERATURES AND HIGH HUMIDITY CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, DAMAGE TO THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM CAN OCCUR. (d) For long anti-icing protection a coat of undiluted anti-icing fluid type II, III or IV previously applied on dry and cleaned surfaces of a parked aircraft will give it some protection against ice, snow, or frost accretion. It may be necessary to apply anti-icing fluid several times to keep the aircraft protected. Local conditions and the duration of parking time will indicate the frequency of application. (e) The anti-icing fluid can also be applied on an aircraft which landed in precipitation conditions, where the air temperature is lightly above freezing. Because the aircraft external surfaces can be below the freezing point, ice can form and adhere to the surface. (f) Location for Deicing/Anti-Icing: 1 If the aircraft is moved from a warm hangar to an open location during freezing precipitation, do one of the steps that follow: a Do the anti-icing procedure before the aircraft is moved out of the warm hangar. b Let the aircraft temperature decrease below freezing, before it is moved out of the hangar. NOTE: Anti-icing application will decrease the possibility that the ice or snow melts when it touches the warm aircraft and then freezes again. 2 If you use unheated water to remove the ice and frost, do the steps that follow: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 860-801-A/200 12-30-01 Page 6 of 32 Rev 50 - Apr 29/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL a Do the procedure in warm hangar. b If anti−icing fluid is not applied, then keep the aircraft in the warm hanger until it is dry. NOTE: It will be necessary to examine those areas where water can collect and freeze. Application of anti-icing fluid will keep the drying requirements to a minimum. (g) When there is slush on runways, examine the aircraft for collected slush and damage to the structure: 1 Examine leading edges, air intakes, engine air inlets, flaps, ailerons, rudder, elevators, water drains, and skin panels for collected ice. Remove the ice if it is necessary: 2 Examine the landing gear wheelwell areas for ice and snow collection and packing. Remove the ice if it is necessary. (2) Necessary Precautions: (a) Do not dispatch the aircraft for take-off when the wings or tail surfaces have an adhering layer of ice, snow, slush, or frost. NOTE: • Be specially careful with the wing and horizontal-stabilizer leading edges. • Frost on the bottom of the wings under the fuel tanks can occur when the fuel temperature is low, the outside air temperature is above freezing, and humidity is high. Takeoff with frost on the fuel tank under wing surfaces is permitted, if frost is not more than 3 mm (1/8 in). (b) The aircraft must be treated symmetrically, that is, left hand and right-hand sides must get the same and complete treatment. NOTE: Symmetrical treatment prevents aerodynamic problems. (c) Engines and APU precautions: CAUTION: • EMBRAER AND SUNDSTRAND DO NOT RECOMMEND APU OPERATION DURING THE AIRCRAFT DEICING/ANTI-ICING PROCEDURE. IF THE APU IS KEPT IN OPERATION DURING THE DEICING/ANTI-ICING PROCEDURE, DAMAGE CAN OCCUR TO IT. IF APU OPERATION IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, MAKE SURE THAT THE APU BLEED AIR VALVE IS CLOSED, PACKS ARE SET AT OFF, AND THE DEICING/ ANTI-ICING FLUID WILL NOT BE APPLIED DIRECTLY TO OR NEAR THE APU AIR INLET. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS. THE FLUID CAN GO INTO THE INLETS. THIS CAN CAUSE APU OVERSPEED AND/OR WHEEL BURST. AS A RESULT, DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. • DO NOT APPLY FLUID DIRECTLY INTO THE ENGINE AND/OR APU AIR INLETS. MAKE SURE THAT THE ENGINE AND/OR APU BLEED VALVES ARE CLOSED.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 1 The engines are usually shut down, but can stay in operation at idle. The bleed valves must be closed during the deicing/anti-icing operations. 2 If the engines or APU are in operation, the ground crew must monitor and keep away from the areas shown in Figure 202: (d) Do not use hard or sharp tools to remove the ice from the airplane surface. (e) Do not apply hot fluid or hot water directly on cold windshields and windows, or crazing can occur. CAUTION: REMOVE ALL DEICING AND ANTI-ICING FLUIDS FROM THE WINDSHIELDS BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT TAKES OFF. THE FLUIDS CAN CAUSE BLURRED VISION OF THE CREW MEMBERS AND DAMAGE TO THE WINDSHIELDS AND WIPERS. (f) Do not apply fluid directly to the cockpit windshields. (g) Do not apply fluid directly to or into these sensors and probes, to prevent damage to them: 1 • Pitot Sensors/Pitot/Static Sensor; • Anemometric and Pressurization Static Ports; • TAT Probes; • Ice Detectors; • Angle-of-Attack (AOA) Sensors. (h) Do not apply fluid into the fuselage openings: • air scoops; • vents; • NACA air inlets, etc. CAUTION: THE REPEATED APPLICATION OF TYPE II, III OR IV FLUIDS, WITHOUT SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF TYPE I FLUID OR HOT WATER, CAN CAUSE RESIDUES TO COLLECT IN AERODYNAMICALLY QUIET AREAS, CAVITIES, AND GAPS. THE RESIDUES CAN REHYDRATE AND FREEZE UNDER CERTAIN TEMPERATURES AND HIGH HUMIDITY CONDITIONS. CONTROL SURFACES MUST BE INSPECTED AND FROM FLUID RESIDUES CLEARED OFF IN TEMPORARY INSPECTIONS AS A FUNCTION OF THE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. (i) The application of hot water or heated Type-I fluid in the first step of the deicing/anti- icing process can keep the formation of residues to a minimum in the aerodynamically quiet areas, cavities, gaps, and flight control systems. (j) Do a periodic inspection of the control surfaces to remove all residual deicing/anti-icing fluid (AMM TASK 12-30-01-200-801-A/600). Operators must define this interval period as a function of their particular operation and experience.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (k) Do a periodic inspection in the APU compartment to remove all residual deicing/ anti- icing fluid from the compartment. Operators must define this interval period as a function of their particular operation and experience. NOTE: You can remove the deicing/Anti-icing fluid with an approved cleaner and soft cloth. (l) Forced air method, necessary precautions: 1 Forced air can not remove adhering contaminants and therefore will not eliminate the need for deicing processes. 2 Forced air can not be directed into engines, auxiliary intakes/exhausts or the Pitot/Static/AOA sensor, Static Port and TAT. 3 Forced air must not be used in areas that are made of rubber, plastic or other soft material, because damage may result. 4 Forced air must not be used near windscreen wipers, because damage may result. 5 When you remove ice, snow or slush from the landing gear and wheel bays areas, take care as debris can cause damage to the components. 6 When you remove ice, snow or slush from the aircraft surfaces, take care to prevent it from entering and accumulating in aerodynamically quiet areas such as control surface hinge areas or from entering engine inlets as special inspections may then be required. 7 Take care to prevent loose debris from impacting personnel or other aircraft surfaces. 8 Forced air applications can not eliminate the need for deicing/anti-icing processes. 9 A subsequent inspection of the critical surfaces will be required after the use of forced air. J. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Before the application of a deicing/anti-icing method, do the steps that follows: (a) Make sure that the aircraft is correctly parked AMM TASK 10-10-01-500-801- A/200 and/or with the parking brake on. (b) Set the flaps to the 0-degree position. (c) Set the aileron and rudder surfaces to the neutral position. (d) Set the gust lock lever to the locked position. (e) Set Pitch Trim to a position between 0ÃÂ° and FULL NOSE DOWN. Thus, the horizontal-stabilizer leading edge will be fully UP. (f) Make sure that all doors and cockpit direct-vision windows are closed. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 860-801-A/200 12-30-01 Page 9 of 32 Rev 50 - Apr 29/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (g) Make sure that the engines and APU bleed shut-off valves are closed. (h) Make sure that the air conditioning packs are in the off position to prevent cabin contamination with the fumes generated from ingestion of deicing/anti-icing fluids in the engine/APU. (2) If there is snow or ice accumulation on the airplane surface, do the procedure that follows for the mechanical removal: CAUTION: • DO NOT USE SHARP TOOLS TO REMOVE ICE FROM THE AIRCRAFT. • DO NOT USE TOOLS TO SCRAPE OR SCRATCH COMPACTED SNOW FROM THE AIRFRAME SURFACES OR FROM THE GAPS BETWEEN FIXED OR MOVABLE SURFACES. (a) You can mechanically remove soft snow if you blow cold air across the airplane surface, or use brooms, ropes, soft hand or rubber scrapers, or a squeegee as follows: 1 With a maintenance lift truck or deicer equipment to get access, pull the snow off the surfaces. Do not try to walk or stand on the aircraft. 2 Control the vehicle along the leading and trailing edges and remove as much snow as possible. 3 A squeegee with a 0.609-meter (24 inch) non-marking hard rubber edge works best. But stiff-bristle brooms can be used. Metal surfaces on the broom or squeegee (attaching hardware included) must be correctly padded to prevent damage to the aircraft surfaces. 4 A 1/2-inch rope with knots approximately 1.524 meters (5 feet) apart can be used to remove snow from the fuselage. Put the rope on the fuselage and, with a person on each side, move the rope rearward and forward in a "sawing" movement while you slowly move along the length of the aircraft. 5 Remove the snow/ice accumulation from the engine intakes. Frozen deposits that adhere to the lower surface of the intake or to the fan blades must be removed with application of hot air. K.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 1 You will do it with an anti-icing fluid. The satisfactory fluid concentration is related to the necessary holdover time (related to the OAT) and to the weather conditions. NOTE: • Refer to the fluid manufacturer’s specifications for fluid mixture, if applicable, and holdover times. • The wing skin temperature can be different from the OAT. If it is lower than the OAT, you can use a stronger mixture. (b) Two-step deicing/anti-icing: 1 You will do the the first step with heated deicing fluid. The correct deicing fluid mixture is related to the OAT. a Apply hot water or a hot mixture of deicing fluid and water to remove the ice, snow, slush or frost from the aircraft surfaces. 2 You will do the second step with anti-icing fluid. This fluid and its concentration are related to the necessary holdover time (related to the OAT) and to the weather conditions. a Apply an overspray of anti-icing fluid or a mixture of them with heated water. You must do this step 3 minutes after the first step, area by area and not letting that the liquid freezes again on the aircraft surface. NOTE: Refer to the fluid manufacturer’s specifications for fluid mixture, if applicable, and holdover times. WARNING: ANTI-ICING/DEICING FLUID IS TOXIC. DO NOT BREATHE ITS MISTS OR SPRAY DURING APPLICATION. DO NOT LET THE MATERIAL TO GET INTO YOUR EYES. DO NOT LET IT TO STAY ON YOUR SKIN FOR A LONG TIME. WEAR THE CORRECT PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. (2) Deicing Fluid Application: (a) Use the minimum fluid mixture possible for the temperature you have. Refer to the fluid manufacturer's specification for the recommended concentrations. (b) For maximum effectiveness and minimum consumption: 1 The solution must be heated and applied near the aircraft surfaces: NOTE: • The fluid temperatures must not be higher than 93ÃÂ°C (200ÃÂ°F) • The correct temperature is 60ÃÂ°C (140ÃÂ°F) minimum at the nozzle. 2 Adjust the fluid stream to a pressure that will not be higher than 10 psi in an 2 2 area of 25 in (161.3 cm ) on the aircraft surface. Larger fluid stream pressures can cause damage to the aircraft surfaces. WARNING: DO NOT APPLY FLUIDS DIRECTLY TO THE POINTS SHOWN IN FIGURE 201.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) The deicing fluid must be applied, as necessary, to the areas shown in the Application Diagram of Figure 203 only. CAUTION: DO NOT POINT SOLID FLUID STREAM DIRECTLY TO THE SURFACE. APPLY AT A LOW ANGLE TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SURFACES. DO NOT USE HIGH-PRESSURE SPRAY TO REMOVE ICE AND SNOW OFF THE AIRCRAFT SURFACES. LARGER FLUID STREAM PRESSURES CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT SURFACES. (d) Apply only the necessary quantity of fluid to remove the ice or snow and let a light coating of fluid stay on the aircraft. Stop until the heated fluid works and dissipates the ice or snow. Do not soak or flush the aircraft. (e) Set the spray nozzle to keep the fluid consumption to a minimum. Obey the instructions that follow: 1 Frost, fog, or light mist setting: • If there is no wind, use the smallest solid stream setting (30 GPM, approximately). 2 Light-to-moderate snow: • Use the smallest solid stream setting (30 GPM, approximately). In windy conditions, it can be necessary to use the second solid-stream setting (60 GPM, approximately). 3 Ice: • Try to remove loose ice from the aircraft skin. Use small solid-stream setting (30 GPM). (f) Always apply fluid to the aircraft high points with wide sweeping movements. Make sweeping movements, as necessary, and let the fluid run on the surface. Do not hold the spray nozzle in one location until the snow dissipates. (g) In strong winds, do the steps that follow: NOTE: Wind conditions will decrease the temperature on the aircraft skin and put the stream of fluid out of shape. 1 Put the aircraft upwind. 2 Point the spray fluid downwind and let the wind help carry the fluid to the aircraft surface. 3 Apply the spray as near to the surface as possible. (3) Hot-Water Deicing Application: (a) Water heated to 82ÃÂ°-93ÃÂ°C (180ÃÂ°-200ÃÂ°F) can be used satisfactorily to remove ice or snow from the aircraft surfaces when the ambient temperature is - 3ÃÂ°C (27ÃÂ°F), stable or on the increase. (b) To not let that water freezes again, anti-icing fluid must be applied to the surface immediately after you remove ice with hot water.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Optionally add 10% glycol to the hot water tank. This will keep to a minimum the freezing of the remaining water in the equipment that you used to remove the ice. (4) Anti-Icing Fluid Application: (a) Remove the snow from the aircraft surfaces before the anti-icing fluid is applied. (b) The decision as to anti-ice is related to some of these conditions: 1 The ambient air temperature. 2 The anticipated ambient air temperature changes. 3 The moisture content of the air (humidity). 4 The amount and type of precipitation which occurs. 5 The length of time that the aircraft will stay on the ground or the holdover time. (c) Regular Use: CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY FLUIDS DIRECTLY TO THE POINTS SHOWN IN FIGURE 201. 1 Anti-icing fluid must be applied, as necessary, to the aircraft surfaces when freezing precipitation can adhere to the aircraft (at the time of dispatch), in the areas shown in the Application Diagram of Figure 204. (d) Optional Use: 1 When you get a frost, snow, freezing rain, or freezing fog warning from the local meteorological service, apply anti-icing fluid to clean the aircraft surfaces before the start of the freezing precipitation. This will keep to a minimum the possibility that the snow and ice bond or decrease the accumulation of frozen precipitation on the aircraft surfaces. It makes the subsequent deicing easier. (e) The anti-icing fluid can also be applied on an aircraft which landed in precipitation conditions, where the air temperature is lightly above freezing. Because the aircraft external surfaces can be below the freezing point, ice can form and adhere to the surface. (f) General: 1 For a satisfactory anti-icing, a film of fluid is necessary on the aircraft surfaces which are clean or which were deiced. For longer anti-icing protection, undiluted, unheated Type II or IV fluid must be used. The high fluid pressures and flow rates usually related to deicing are not necessary for this operation and, where possible, pump speeds must be decreased as necessary. The nozzle of the spray gun must be adjusted to give a medium spray. NOTE: • Undiluted fluid is usually applied cold to the surfaces of the aircraft.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Type-I fluids are not satisfactory when used for anti-icing and gives a minimum holdover time. (g) Anti-Icing Fluid Strategy: CAUTION: IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ANTI-ICING FLUIDS DO NOT FLOW UNIFORMLY ON THE WING LEADING EDGES AND ON THE HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL STABILIZERS. THESE SURFACES MUST BE MONITORED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CORRECTLY COATED WITH FLUID. 1 Do the anti-icing procedure as near the departure time as possible to better use the available holdover time. Distribute the anti-icing fluid uniformly. To control the uniformity, do a visual check on all horizontal aircraft surfaces during application of the fluid. The necessary amount will be visually shown by the fluid that starts to drip off the leading edge and trailing edge. (h) Fluid-Related Limits: CAUTION: AN AIRCRAFT THAT WAS ANTI-ICED MUST NOT GET OTHER COATING OF ANTI-ICING FLUID DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE CONTAMINATED FILM. IF A NEW PROTECTION BEFORE THE NEXT FLIGHT IS NECESSARY, FIRST DEICE THE EXTERNAL SURFACES (AND REMOVE ALL RESIDUES) WITH A HOT DEICING FLUID MIXTURE AND THEN APPLY NEW ANTI-ICING FLUID. 1 For the application of the deicing/anti-icing fluids, refer to the fluid manufacturer's specifications (5) Forced Air method application: (a) You can remove the snow (that does not adhere to the surface) with forced air. Use the pressure supply unit and apply the forced air to the surfaces: • From a distance of 1,5 to 6 m (5 to 20 ft). • With a maximum pressure of 34,5 kPa (5 psi). • At the minimum angle to the surface. (6) For effective removal of snow and ice, use the procedures that follow: NOTE: Always apply fluid in the aft direction. This is to prevent fluid accumulation in aerodynamically quiet areas. (a) Wing deicing procedure: CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU REMOVE ICE AND SNOW FROM WING SURFACE WHERE VORTEX GENERATORS ARE INSTALLED NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THEM. 1 Spray the fluid from the wing tip inboard to the root and sweep from the leading edge to the trailing edge.
