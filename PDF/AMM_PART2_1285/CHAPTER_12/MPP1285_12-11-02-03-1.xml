			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 12-11-02-600-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. FUEL TANK GRAVITY REFUELING - SERVICING A. General (1) This task gives the procedure to gravity-refuel the fuel tanks. (2) The tanks are gravity-refueled through the filler caps installed on the wing top surface. NOTE: • As Fuel-System Icing Inhibitors (FSII), use Ethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether (EGME), which obeys MIL-I-27686 (NATO S-748), ASTM-D-4171 or GOST 8313 or Di-Ethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether (Di-EGME), which obeys MIL- I-85470A. Refer to the latest revision of the Rolls-Royce Operations Manual 71-00-00. • You can also use the corrosion/lubricity additive found in the Qualified Product List of MIL-I-25017. • Follow the fluid manufacturer's specifications to find the additive proportions for each fuel. (3) Refer to the List of the Products Approved to be Used on the Aircraft ( AMM MPP 20-30-01/200). B.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-005-A (1) Obey the Safety Conditions for the Fuel and Oxygen System Servicing ( AMM MPP 12-10-00/200). (2) Ground the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-02-910-801-A/200). NOTE: • Do all grounding connections between the fuel source, the aircraft, and the fuel nozzle (refer to the requirements of the Local Regulatory Authorities). • Make sure that the fueling source is with filter. If not, have a chamois- leather filter with funnel to correctly filter the fuel. (3) Open filler caps 541FT for the LH tank or 641FT for the RH tank ( AMM MPP 06-44-00/100). J. Gravity Refueling (Figure 301)  SUBTASK 650-005-A (1) Put the fueling nozzle into the filler port. (2) Start the fueling. At the same time, monitor the fuel level in the tank. (a) You can refuel the two wing tanks at the same time or first one and then the other. (b) Make sure that there is no fuel imbalance when the procedure is completed. (3) Remove the fueling nozzle from the filler port after you have the correct fuel level in the tank. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-005-A (1) Remove the grounding cable from the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-02-910-801-A/200).
