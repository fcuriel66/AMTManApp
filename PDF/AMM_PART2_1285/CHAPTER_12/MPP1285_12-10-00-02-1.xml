			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • WARNING: CLOTHING WET WITH FUEL MUST BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY AND THE RELATED SKIN AREA MUST BE FULLY FLUSHED. ALL JET FUELS CAUSE INJURY TO THE SKIN. DO NOT LET THESE FLUIDS TOUCH YOU. • IF FUEL GETS INTO YOUR EYES, WASH THE EYES IMMEDIATELY WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF WATER; THEN GET MEDICAL SERVICES. • MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNICIAN IS TRAINED AND PREPARED TO DO THE FUEL SYSTEM SERVICING. • FOR CORRECT AND CAREFUL HANDLING OF SUPPORT EQUIPMENT, MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL MUST KNOW THE SYSTEM AND ITS SAFETY CONDITIONS. • DO THE FUEL SYSTEM MAINTENANCE ONLY IN AREA WHICH PERMITS THE FREE MOVEMENT AND ACCESS OF FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT AND PERSONS. MAKE SURE THAT FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ARE AVAILABLE, HAVE A MINIMUM CAPACITY TO OBEY THE LOCAL FIRE CODES, AND ARE READY TO BE USED IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. • THE AREA WHERE THESE TASKS WILL BE DONE MUST HAVE A GOOD FLOW OF AIR AND NO FUEL VAPOR CONCENTRATIONS OR EQUIPMENT WHICH CAN CAUSE FLAMES OR SPARKS. • "NO SMOKING" SIGNS MUST BE PUT WITHIN A RADIUS OF 50 FT (15 METERS) OF THE OPERATION AREA. • DO NOT WEAR CLOTHING IN SYNTHETIC MATERIAL OR CLOTHING WHICH HAS METAL ZIPPERS OR BUTTONS. THERE CAN BE A SPARK. • ALL PERSONS WHO DO THESE TASKS MUST DISCHARGE THE STATIC ELECTRICITY FROM THEIR BODIES. FOR THIS, THEY MUST TOUCH A STATIC GROUND CABLE OR GROUNDED OBJECT BEFORE THEY START THE OPERATIONS. • ELECTRICALLY GROUND ALL THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE CORRECT CABLES ( AMM MPP 20-40-02/200). • STATICALLY GROUND ALL ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT ( AMM MPP 20-40-02/200). THIS PREVENTS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF STATIC ELECTRICITY WHEN THE EQUIPMENT IS USED. • USE EXPLOSION-PROOF LAMPS, IF AN EXTERNAL LIGHT SOURCE IS NECESSARY. • ALL EXTERNAL LIGHT SOURCES MUST BE MOVED AWAY FROM THE AIRCRAFT BEFORE THE TASKS ARE STARTED. • ALL SUPPORT EQUIPMENT NOT NECESSARY FOR THESE TASKS MUST BE MOVED AWAY FOR A MINIMUM OF 50 FT (15 METERS) FROM THE AIRCRAFT. • STOP REFUELING PROCEDURES WHEN THUNDERSTORMS OR LIGHTNING ARE IN LESS THAN 16 KM (10 MILES). • MAKE SURE THAT NO HIGH FREQUENCY RADIO TRANSMITTER IS OPERATED WITHIN A RADIUS OF 200 FT (60 METERS) OF THE AIRCRAFT OR A RADAR EQUIPMENT WITHIN A RADIUS OF 400 FT (120 METERS).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • THESE TASKS MUST NOT BE DONE INDOORS OR WITHIN 100 FT (30 METERS) OF HANGARS. • THE AIRCRAFT MUST BE PARKED AT RAMP LEVEL, HEADED INTO THE WIND. • INSTALLATION OR REMOVAL OF THE BATTERIES OR ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT ARE NOT ALLOWED. • KEEP FREE OF VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT THE AREAS AROUND THE FUEL TANKS AND VENT, DURING THE PRESSURE REFUELING PROCEDURE. • DO NOT REFUEL THE AIRCRAFT IF THERE IS AN OVERHEAT INDICATION IN THE AIRCRAFT. • DO NOT FILL OR CHANGE OXYGEN BOTTLES DURING THE REFUELING PROCEDURES. • DO NOT START THE APU DURING THE REFUEL/DEFUEL PROCEDURE AFTER AN APU AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN OR FAILED START EVENT OCCURS. • IF A FUEL SPILLAGE OCCURS SHUT THE APU DOWN AND DO NOT START IT. • PREVENT FUEL SPILLAGE. SOAK IT UP IMMEDIATELY IF IT OCCURS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE FUEL LEVEL IN TANKS IS SYMMETRICAL AFTER REFUELING. • DURING THE PRESSURE REFUELING PROCEDURE, MAKE SURE THAT THE REFUELING PRESSURE IS BETWEEN 35 AND 50 PSI. AN OVERPRESSURE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT AND INJURY TO THE PERSONS. AN UNDERPRESSURE CAN CAUSE UNSATISFACTORY OPERATION OF THE REFUELING COMPONENTS. • MAKE SURE THAT THE FUEL QUANTITY UNIT IS CORRECT. A WRONG READING OF THE FUEL QUANTITY CAN CAUSE AN AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT. • MAKE SURE THAT THE NACA AIR INTAKE IS NOT BLOCKED AND THAT THE NACA AIR INTAKE IS FREE FROM BLOCKAGE.IF YOU NOT OBEY THESE CAUTIONS, DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT CAN OCCUR.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • WARNING: HIGH-PRESSURE OXYGEN CAN CAUSE SUDDEN COMBUSTION IF IT TOUCHES OIL, GREASE, SOLVENTS, HYDROCARBONS IN GENERAL, CLOTH FIBERS, METAL CHIPS, ETC. • FOR THE CORRECT AND CAREFUL HANDLING OF SUPPORT EQUIPMENT, MAINTENANCE TECHNICIANS MUST KNOW THE SYSTEM AND ITS SAFETY CONDITIONS. • HOSES AND END-FITTINGS MUST BE DECONTAMINATED AND THE RECHARGING PANEL MUST BE KEPT FULLY CLEAN. • IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT HANDS, CLOTHING, AND TOOLS BE FULLY CLEAN. USE GLOVES, APRON, AND SHOES WITH RUBBER SOLES. • DO THIS TASK ONLY IN AREA WHICH PERMITS THE FREE MOVEMENT AND ACCESS OF FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT AND PERSONS. MAKE SURE THAT FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ARE AVAILABLE, HAVE A MINIMUM CAPACITY TO OBEY THE LOCAL FIRE CODES, AND ARE READY TO BE USED IF THERE IS EMERGENCY SITUATION. • "NO SMOKING" SIGNS MUST BE PUT WITHIN A RADIUS OF 50 FT (15 METERS) OF THE OPERATION AREA. • GROUND ALL SUPPORT EQUIPMENT TO BE USED FOR THESE TASKS. • ALL SUPPORT EQUIPMENT NOT NECESSARY FOR THESE TASKS MUST BE MOVED AWAY FOR A MINIMUM OF 50 FT (15 METERS) FROM THE AIRCRAFT.
