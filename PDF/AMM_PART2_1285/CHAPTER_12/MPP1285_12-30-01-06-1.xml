			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL COLD WEATHER MAINTENANCE - INSPECTION/CHECK EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to examine the control surfaces for dried de-icing/anti-icing fluid residues. B. The repeated application of type-II, -III, or -IV fluids, without subsequent application of type I or hot water, can cause residues to collect in aerodynamically quiet areas. These residues can re- hydrate and freeze under certain temperatures and high-humidity condition. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: ANTI-ICING/DEICING FLUID IS TOXIC. DO NOT PERMIT THE MATERIAL TO GET INTO YOUR EYES. DO NOT PERMIT IT TO STAY ON YOUR SKIN FOR A LONG TIME. WEAR GLOVES AND GOGGLES. CAUTION: • PREFERABLY DO THIS PROCEDURE WHEN THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND THE AIRCRAFT SKIN TEMPERATURE ARE ABOVE 3ÃÂ°C (38ÃÂ°F). OR THE WATER APPLIED CAN FREEZE. • THE USE OF OTHER ANTI-ICE FLUID THAN AMS 1424 TYPE I CAN CAUSE THE FLUID RESIDUE ACCUMULATION. (1) If the ambient temperature is below 3ÃÂ°C (38ÃÂ°F), do this task in a hangar with proper temperature or mix AMS 1424 Type I fluid with water whenever water is required in the procedure. It is also recommended to heat the AMS 1424 Type I-and-water solution to 60ÃÂ°C (140ÃÂ°F). NOTE: Consult the fluid manufacturer to know the fluid limitations, safety data, and the correct percentage of type I fluid to prevent the water freezing. (2) Obey the procedures given in AMM TASK 10-10-01-500-801-A/200 for normal parking. J. General Visual Inspection of the Horizontal Stabilizer (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 280-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE FLIGHT CONTROLS WILL NOT BE ACTUATED WHILE YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE MOVING PARTS, WHICH COULD INJURE YOU. CAUTION: • TRAINED AND QUALIFIED PERSONS MUST ALWAYS DO THE INSPECTION AND REMOVAL OF THE DE-ICING/ANTI-ICING DRIED FLUIDS. • IF YOU DO NOT RE-HYDRATE THE FLUID RESIDUES IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU DO NOT SEE THEM. RE-HYDRATED FLUID RESIDUES MAY SWELL MANY TIMES THEIR ORIGINAL VOLUME. (1) With the aid of a spray bottle, moist but do not soak with water the following parts of the horizontal stabilizer, and wait 10 minutes for the fluid residue to swell. – Elevator hinge points (Figure 601, sheet 1, DET.

General (1) This task gives the procedures to examine for, and remove, dried deicing/anti-icing fluid residues on the elevator control system installed in the tail boom. This procedure is separate from AMM TASK 12-30-01-200-801-A/600 because the time to do it is longer. And it is longer because, to do this procedure, it is necessary to remove and install the tail boom. (2) The repeated application of type-II, -III, or -IV fluids, without subsequent application of type I or hot water, can cause residues to collect in aerodynamically quiet areas. These residues can re-hydrate and freeze under certain temperatures and high-humidity condition. B.
