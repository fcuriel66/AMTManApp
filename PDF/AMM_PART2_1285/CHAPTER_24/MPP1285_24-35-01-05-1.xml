(3) On aircraft POST-MOD SB145-32-0036, install the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (4) Open maintenance panel door 114BZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) to get access to the backup battery box. J. Functionally Check Back-up Battery (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Do the check, on the back-up battery, as follows: (a) Set the TEST switch, located on the back-up, to TEST and hold it for five seconds maximum. Result: 1 The HEATER ON indicator LED, located on the back-up, comes on. NOTE: If the HEATER ON indicator LED does not come on, restore the back-up battery ( AMM TASK 24-35-01-900-801-A/200). 2 The voltage level indicator LEDs, located on the back-up, come on. NOTE: The back-up battery is operational if the related indicator LED comes on at 24 V DC minimum. If not, restore the back-up battery ( AMM TASK 24-35-01-900-801-A/200). (b) Release the TEST switch.
