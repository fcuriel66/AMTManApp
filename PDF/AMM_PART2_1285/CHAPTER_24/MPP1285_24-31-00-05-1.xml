Preparation SUBTASK 841-004-A (1) Make sure that the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches, on the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, are set at AUTO. (2) Make sure that the GEN 1 (2, 3 or 4) POR and GEN 1 (2, 3 or 4) OUTVOLT circuit breakers are closed, on the LH/RH Electrical-Power Control/Distribution box. (3) Start the engines ( AMM TASK 71-00-01-910-801-A/200). (4) Make sure that the SHED BUSES switch, on the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, is set at AUTO. NOTE: If you use the APU to start the engines, stop the APU generator after the engines are in operation.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Test Procedure (Figure 504)  SUBTASK 710-004-A (1) Do the check as follows: (a) Set MFD 1 (or 2) to the ELEC page (AMM SDS 31-41-00/1). Result: 1 The ELEC page shows GEN 1, 2, 3, and 4 nominal current and voltage values boxed in green (AMM SDS 24-31-00/1). 2 The ELEC page shows the buses in green. (b) Set the GEN 1 pushbutton, on the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, to OFF/RESET. Result: 1 On the GEN 1 pushbutton, the striped bar comes on. 2 The EICAS display shows the GEN 1 OFF BUS caution message. 3 The master CAUTION lights flash. 4 The ELEC page shows the GEN 1 voltage and current boxed in amber. (c) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (d) Set the GEN 2 pushbutton, on the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, to OFF/RESET. Result: 1 On the GEN 2 pushbutton, the striped bar comes on. 2 The EICAS display shows the GEN 1-2 OFF BUS and SHED BUS 1-2 OFF caution messages. 3 The master CAUTION lights flash. 4 The ELEC page shows the GEN 1-2 voltage and current boxed in amber. (e) Push a master CAUTION light. Result: 1 The master CAUTION lights go off. (f) Set the GEN 3 pushbutton, on the electrical panel, on overhead panel, to OFF/ RESET. Result: 1 On the GEN 3 pushbutton, the striped bar comes on. 2 The EICAS display shows the GEN 1-2-3 OFF BUS caution messages. 3 On the EICAS display, the SHED BUS 1-2 OFF caution messages stay in view. 4 The master CAUTION lights flash. 5 The ELEC page shows the GEN 1-2-3 voltage and current boxed in amber. (g) Push a master CAUTION light. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-803-A/500 24-31-00 Page 17 of 20 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>
