			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Engines I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE GPU PUSHBUTTON, BATT 1 AND BATT 2 SWITCHES, ON THE ELECTRICAL PANEL, ON THE OVERHEAD PANEL, ARE SET AT OFF. (1) Lubricate the new O-ring (21) (IPC 24-31-01) with engine oil and install it at the main generator (2) shaft, whether the main generator (2) is new or not. (2) Install the exhaust header (22) to the main generator (2). (3) Put the main generator (2) V-band clamp (1) on the mounting pad (18). (4) Tighten the nut of the V-band clamp (1) to approximately 2/3 of the specified torque value. (5) Connect the air duct (5) to the main generator (2). (6) Lightly hit the V-band clamp (1) at different locations around the external diameter with a rubber mallet and a stick. (7) Tighten the nut of the V-band clamp (1) to the specified value. NOTE: Do step (6) and then do step (7) as many times as necessary to get a condition in which there is no reduction in torque. (8) Tighten the clamp (4) which attaches the air duct (5) to the main generator (2). (9) Safety (lockwire P/N = MS20995C20) the clamp (4). (10) If the two electrical cables (8) were disconnected from the interconnection bar (14), do as follows: (a) Connect the two electrical cables (8) to the interconnection bar (14). CAUTION:SEE THEIR IDENTIFICATION MARKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL CABLES ARE INSTALLED CORRECTLY AND THAT THE TORQUE VALUE IS APPLIED CORRECTLY. INCORRECT INSTALLATION OF THE CABLES WILL CAUSE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN THE AIRCRAFT. (b) Tighten the self-locking nut (10), lock washer (9), two washers (7), and bolt (6) which attach the two electrical cables (8) to the interconnection bar (14). (11) Make sure that there are two or more threads on the other side of the nut (10). If not, replace the bolt (6) with a longer one and do step (10). (12) Connect the electrical cable (11) and interconnection bar (14) to the main generator (2).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION:SEE THEIR IDENTIFICATION MARKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL CABLE AND INTERCONNECTION BAR ARE INSTALLED CORRECTLY AND THAT THE TORQUE VALUE IS APPLIED CORRECTLY (THE TORQUE VALUE OF STUD "B+" IS DIFFERENT FROM STUD "E-"). INCORRECT INSTALLATION OF THE CABLE AND INTERCONNECTION BAR WILL CAUSE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN THE AIRCRAFT. (13) Tighten the two self-locking nuts (13) and two Belleville washers (12) which attach the electrical cable (11) and interconnection bar (14) to the main generator (2). CAUTION:SEE THEIR IDENTIFICATION MARKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL CABLES AND INTERCONNECTION BAR ARE INSTALLED CORRECTLY AND THAT THE TORQUE VALUE IS APPLIED CORRECTLY. INCORRECT INSTALLATION OF THE CABLES AND INTERCONNECTION BAR WILL CAUSE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS IN THE AIRCRAFT. (14) Put the terminal cover (15) in its installation position. (15) Tighten the two screws (16) which attach the terminal cover (15). (16) Tighten the screw (20) which attaches the support (19) to the exhaust header (22). (17) Connect the electrical connector (3) to the main generator (2). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close LH lower cowling 413 or RH lower cowling 423 ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-400-801- A/400) as applicable. (2) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-ON tag from the GPU pushbutton. (3) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tag from the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches. (4) Do the operational test of the Main Generation System ( AMM TASK 24-31-00-700-803-A/500). (5) Do the engine leak test (operate at max. takeoff power for 3 minutes minimum, but not for more than 5 minutes). Refer to the latest revision of Rolls-Royce (MM CSP 34022). NOTE: Make sure that there is no leakage through generator mounting-pad drain. If the leakage comes from the O-ring of the generator, replace the O-ring. If the leakage does not come from the O-ring, refer to the latest revision of Rolls- Royce (FIM CSP 34064).
