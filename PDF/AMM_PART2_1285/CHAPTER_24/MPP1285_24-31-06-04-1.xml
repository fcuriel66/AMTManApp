Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Do the bonding procedure, method 3 (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200) to install the connection bar (4) on the structure. (2) Put the main generator shunt (5) in position. CAUTION: REFER TO THE MATCH MARKS MADE DURING THE REMOVAL WHEN YOU CONNECT THE ELECTRICAL WIRES OR CABLES. INCORRECT CONNECTION OF WIRES OR CABLES WILL CAUSE MALFUNCTION OR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT. (3) Before you connect the electrical cables (14), wires (6)(10), and connections (4) to the shunt (5), refer to the match marks made during removal procedure. (4) Put the connection bar (4) in position. CAUTION: DO NOT INSTALL WASHERS BELOW THE CONNECTION BAR. IF THE CONNECTION BAR IS NOT IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE SHUNT AND WITH THE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE, LOCALIZED RESISTANCE HEATING CAN OCCUR AND CAUSE THE ASSEMBLAGE TO BURN. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT YOU TORQUE THE CONNECTION BAR BOLTS TO THE CORRECT VALUE. INCORRECT TORQUE CAN CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS TO THE EQUIPMENT. (5) Tighten the two bolts (13), two lock washers (12), four washers (11) and (18), and two nuts (19) that attach the connection bar (4) to the structure. Apply a torque of 7.9 - 12.4 N.m (70 - 110 lb.in). Refer to (Figure 401). CAUTION: DO NOT INSTALL WASHERS BELOW THE CONNECTION BAR. IF THE CONNECTION BAR IS NOT IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE SHUNT AND WITH THE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURE, LOCALIZED RESISTANCE HEATING CAN OCCUR AND CAUSE THE ASSEMBLAGE TO BURN. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT YOU TORQUE THE CONNECTION BAR BOLTS TO THE CORRECT VALUE. INCORRECT TORQUE WILL CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS TO THE EQUIPMENT. (6) Tighten the bolt (1), lock washer (2), and washer (3) which attach the connection bar (4) to the shunt (5). Apply a torque of 14.7 - 16.9 N.m (130 - 150 lb.in). Refer to (Figure 401). (7) Do the bonding test (AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/200) on the connection bar (4). (8) Do the bonding protection ( AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-802-A/200) of the area around the connection bar. Refer to (Figure 401). (9) Put the electrical cable (14) in position. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 24-31-06 Page 6 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) If you installed main generator 1 shunt or main generator 3 shunt, close access panel 414AB (AMM 06-43-01/101). (2) If you installed main generator 2 shunt or main generator 4 shunt, close access panel 424AB (AMM 06-43-01/101). (3) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-ON tag from the GPU pushbutton. (4) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tag from the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches. (5) Remove the DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tag from the BACKUP pushbutton. (6) Set the BACKUP pushbutton to AUTO.
