			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL JACKING - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY: ACFT MODEL(S) EMB-145 1. General A. This section gives the tasks for the aircraft complete or partial jacking. B. The lifting of damaged aircraft is given in the I.G.F.E.R. (Instructions for Ground Fire Extinguishing and Rescue) manual. C. If all tires are flat (on the main and nose landing gears), the complete jacking of the aircraft will be necessary to do the wheel servicing. D. There are three jacking points on the aircraft. The forward jacking point is below the fuselage, in the nose area, while the others are below the wings. Refer to Figure 201 for aircraft jacking points. E. The partial jacking of the aircraft is done at the jacking point of each landing gear. This permits each wheel to be changed independently. NOTE: Before you continue the aircraft jacking, refer to Figure 202 for weight limitations. F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION:IF NECESSARY TO JACK THE AIRCRAFT OUTSIDE THE HANGAR, THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE WIND SPEED IS 10 KNOTS WITH THE FLAPS IN ZERO DEGREE POSITION AND THE GUST LOCK AT THE LOCKED POSITION. CAUTION: DO NOT DO THE COMPLETE LIFT PROCEDURE UNDER RAINY WEATHER. WATER CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE HYDRAULIC JACKS. (1) The aircraft must be jacked on a level ground, away from the wind or, which is better, in a hangar. Obey the usual parking conditions ( AMM TASK 10-10-01-500-801-A/ 200). (2) Make sure that the landing gear safety pins are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (3) Remove from the area below and around the aircraft all equipment that is not necessary. (4) Make sure that the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches, on the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, are set at OFF. CAUTION: • RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE BEFORE THE JACKING OPERATIONS. • DO NOT JACK UP THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE MAIN DOOR OPEN AND THE HANDRAIL DISENGAGED. (5) Monitor the landing gear wheels to prevent longitudinal movement while jacks GSE 191 and GSE 004 are installed. J. Complete Jacking (Figure 201)  (Figure 202)  (Figure 203)  SUBTASK 580-024-B CAUTION: • DURING THE COMPLETE AIRCRAFT JACKING OPERATION, NO PERSON IS PERMITTED ON THE AIRCRAFT. • IN BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS, THE HANGAR DOORS MUST ALSO BE CLOSED. • THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED FUEL ASYMMETRY BETWEEN WINGS IS 363 KG (800 LB). • ABOVE 17000 KG, ONLY THE LANDING GEAR JACKING IS PERMITTED. • THE MINIMUM CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE LANDING GEAR WHEEL AND THE GROUND IS 100 MILLIMETERS (APPROXIMATELY 4 INCHES). (1) Before you continue the aircraft jacking, refer to Figure 202 for weight limitations. (2) Correctly put jacks GSE 191 and GSE 004 below the jacking points (Figure 203). NOTE: If the aircraft is powered, open the DFDR CB before complete aircraft jacking, shoring and lowering procedures. After these procedures, close the CB back.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: DURING THE JACKING PROCEDURE, MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS IN THE CONSTANT ATTITUDE. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (3) Operate the three jacks GSE 191 and GSE 004 simultaneously and at the same time go turning the locking nuts to lock the jacks. Thus, jacking is symmetrical and the aircraft is always kept level while it is lifted up to the necessary height. (4) Make sure that the jacks GSE 191 and GSE 004 are locked. NOTE: Do not permit the aircraft to stay jacked for a longer period than that necessary. If it is necessary for the aircraft to stay jacked for a long period, install the shoring supports.
