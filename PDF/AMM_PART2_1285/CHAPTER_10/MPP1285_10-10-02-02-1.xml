			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) For the two short and long out-of-operation time procedures, obey the procedures given in AMM TASK 10-10-01-500-801-A/200 for normal parking and in AMM TASK 10-20-01-500-801-A/200 for mooring. J. Short Out-of-Operation Time SUBTASK 580-002-A CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY THE PARKING BRAKE. USE ONLY THE CHOCKS AGAINST THE WHEELS. (1) Exterior Surface Protection. (a) Refer to these steps and apply Xzilon 3 AECI product for a temporary protection of mirror-finished (polished) leading edges and engine inlet (unpainted surfaces). Painted surfaces and parts at high operational temperatures must not be coated. NOTE: • The film of the Xzilon 3 AECI protective product must not be have a thickness of more than 0.06 mm and it must not have cracks, sags/ runs, and impurities. • The use of Xzilon 3 AECI is recommended, but not mandatory. But, without the Xzilon 3 AECI protection, deterioration of the not painted surfaces can occur because of corrosion. 1 Apply two smooth crosscoats. 2 Wait 20 minutes for the coat of the Xzilon 3 AECI protective product to cure. (2) Equipment/Furnishings. (a) Install covers on the seats. (b) No humidity control is necessary for the carpets and seats which stay in the aircraft for 30 days after the out-of-operation time starts. (c) If the toilet waste systems were filled and operated, do the waste disposal service (AMM TASK 38-30-00-600-801-A/300). (d) Do a visual check of the galleys for unsatisfactory conditions and correct as necessary. (e) Close the window shades to prevent damage to the seat and carpet materials because of the sun ultraviolet rays. If the seats and carpets are removed, the window shades can be lifted. (f) Open the closet and galley doors to permit air circulation. (g) At each 30 days, open the main door, service door (if applicable) and baggage door for a minimum of 2 hours or during the accomplishment of other maintenance tasks in the aircraft to let the air flow. (3) Landing Gear. (a) Examine all landing gear wheels. (b) Release the parking brake. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 500-801-A/200 10-10-02 Page 5 of 43 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Make sure that all landing gear safety pins are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (d) Lubricate these points with MIL-G-23827 grease: 1 Surface of the main-gear uplock hooks. 2 Surface open to the air of the main-gear spherical trunnion bearing and ball joints. (e) Turn the wheels one-third of turn at each 14 days. This is necessary also for aircraft kept stopped with tires in unsatisfactory conditions to keep the risk of wheel bearing fretting to a minimum. To do this, do one of these procedures: 1 Lift the wheels with the axle jack put at the jack point (partial lifting) (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-803-A/200). 2 Tow (move) the aircraft ( AMM TASK 09-10-00-500-801-A/200) or (AMM TASK 09-10-01-500-801-A/200) as applicable. 3 Put the aircraft on jacks (complete lifting) (AMM TASK 07-10-00-500-801-A/ 200). (f) Do a check and keep the normal tire pressure ( AMM TASK 32-49-01-600-801-A/ 300). (4) Fuel System. (a) Drain the fuel tanks to do the check for the presence of water at each 15 days ( AMM TASK 12-11-03-600-801-A/300). 1 If during consecutive drainings of the tanks, the presence of water is found, make the analysis of microorganisms in the tanks ( AMM TASK 28-11-00-300-803-A/700). (5) Electrical/Electronic Systems. (a) These procedures apply to the aircraft parked for less than 60 days. 1 It is recommended that you remove batteries 1, 2, and backup battery from the aircraft for an aircraft parking longer than 8 days. Refer to AMM TASK 24-36-01-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 24-35-01-000-801-A/400. However, to store the batteries in the aircraft for long periods, you must obey the conditions that follow. If these conditions cannot be met, damage to the batteries can occur and they cannot work correctly when they are required to. • The recommended temperature range for batteries 1 and 2 is + 20ÃÂ°C ÃÂ± 15ÃÂ°C (68ÃÂ°F ÃÂ± 27ÃÂ°F). • Occasional excursions into the range of - 60ÃÂ°C to + 60ÃÂ°C (- 76ÃÂ°F to + 140ÃÂ°F) are permitted. • Recommended humidity levels are &lt; 70%. • The recommended temperature for the backup battery is not more than 29ÃÂ°C (85ÃÂ°F). In low temperatures, there is no danger of damage EMB-145  - AMM 1285 500-801-A/200 10-10-02 Page 6 of 43 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
