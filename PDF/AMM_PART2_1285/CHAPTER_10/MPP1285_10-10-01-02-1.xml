(2) Make sure that there is a minimum distance between the parked aircraft to permit their movement. Make sure that there is a minimum distance of 4.5 meters between an operating APU exhaust port and an adjacent aircraft fuel-tank vent. (3) The aircraft is made to be resistant to winds of less than 65 kt when it is moored. If the aircraft is submitted to On-Ground Gale-Force Winds (Winds greater than 50 kt for aircraft equipped with Mechanical Gust Lock and winds greater than 65 kt for aircraft equipped with Electromechanical Gust Lock) do the applicable inspection ( AMM TASK 05-50-26-200-802- A/600).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 10-10-01-500-806-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 7. AIRCRAFT RETURN TO SERVICE (PARKING IN VOLCANIC ASH CONDITION) A. General (1) This task gives the procedure to do the aircraft return to service after it has been parked into a volcanic ash condition. (2) A volcanic ash condition occurs when there is a volcanic ash fallout and the aircraft is parking/parked. A volcanic ash is a highly abrasive material that can corrode the contaminated surfaces. (3) If the aircraft flies through a cloud of volcanic ash, land and/or takeoff or does ground operations (towing, taxiing) in a volcanic ash fallout condition, ( AMM TASK 05-50-18-200-801-A/600) must be accomplished. (4) When a specific cleaning procedure for a component or surface is not available, use these tools to remove/clean the volcanic ash contamination from the surfaces, compartments, piston of the actuators, or other components as applicable: (a) vacuum cleaner (b) lint-free wiper cloth (c) soft bristle brush (d) Broom (5) The approved cleaning material to remove the adhesive tape residue from the aircraft fuselage are: (a) Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) (b) Diestone Solvent - CONTEC EX420602 B.
