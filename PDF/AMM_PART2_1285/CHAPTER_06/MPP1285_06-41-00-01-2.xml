The location of the access doors and panels is shown in detail in each of the subsequent sub-zones: (1) Sub-zone 110 - (from STA X = 0.0 thru STA X = 600.0) and fuselage forward section I (from STA X = 600.0 to STA X = 2364.0). (2) Sub-zone 120 - Fuselage forward section II (from STA X = 2364.0 to STA X = 4154.5). (3) Sub-zone 130 - Fuselage center section I (from STA X = 4154.5 to STA X = 7131.0). (4) Sub-zone 140 - Fuselage center section II (from STA X = 7131.0 to STA X = 9984.0). (5) Sub-zone 150 - Fuselage center section III (from STA X = 9984.0 to STA X = 15721.0). (6) Sub-zone 160 - Fuselage center section IV (from STA X = 15721.0 to STA X = 17253.0). (7) Sub-zone 170 - Fuselage rear section I (from STA X = 17253.0 to STA X = 22041.0). (8) Sub-zone 190 - Wing-to-fuselage attachment fairing. B. Major zone 200 includes the upper fuselage as far as the rear pressure bulkhead. The location of the access doors and panels is shown in detail in each of the subsequent sub-zones: (1) Sub-zone 210 - Fuselage forward section I (from STA X = 600.0 to STA X = 2364.0). (2) Sub-zone 220 - Fuselage forward section II (from STA X = 2364.0 to STA X = 4154.5). (3) Sub-zone 230 - Fuselage center section I (from STA X = 4154.5 to STA X = 7131.0). (4) Sub-zone 240 - Fuselage center section II (from STA X = 7131.0 to STA X = 9984.0). (5) Sub-zone 250 - Fuselage center section III (from STA X = 9984.0 to STA X = 15721.0). (6) Sub-zone 260 - Fuselage center section IV (from STA X = 15721.0 to STA X = 17253.0). (7) Sub-zone 270 - Fuselage rear section I (from STA X = 17253.0 to STA X = 22041.0). C. To get access to the equipment and components through the access doors and panels, refer to: (1) 6-41-01 - Fuselage External Access Doors and Panels. (2) 6-41-02 - Floor Panels.
