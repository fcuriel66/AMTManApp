			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL SELCAL - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH SELCAL SYSTEM 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do the test of the SELCAL system. B. The selective calling (SELCAL) system permits a ground station to call an aircraft or group of aircraft by the radio communication system without the need for the flight crew to continuously monitor the station frequency. C. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Open maintenance panel door 223LZ ( AMM MPP 06-41-03/100). (b) On the maintenance panel, in the cockpit, set the SELCAL test switch to TEST. Result: 1 On the SELCAL annunciator panel, on the instrument panel, the VHF 2 and/or HF light flashes. 2 In the aural warning system, SELCAL is heard one time. (c) On the control wheel, set the PTT/HOT Mic switch to PTT. Result: 1 Make sure that the VHF 2 and/or HF light goes off. (d) On the maintenance panel, in the cockpit, set the SELCAL test switch to TEST. Result: 1 On the SELCAL annunciator panel, on the instrument panel, the VHF 2 and/or HF light flashes. 2 In the aural warning system, SELCAL is heard one time. (e) On the SELCAL annunciator panel, on the instrument panel, push the VHF 2 or HF pushbutton. Result: 1 Make sure that the VHF 2 and/or HF light goes off. (2) (This step is applicable only to the VHF SELCAL system) Do the operational test of the SELCAL system with the VHF 2 transceiver as follows: NOTE: Make sure that the VHF transmitter and the VHF receiver are set at the same frequency. (a) On the SELCAL decoder computer, use the code selection thumb wheel switches to set the aircraft code. NOTE: The SELCAL selection of codes is made by four knobs mounted on the front of the decoder. Above each knob there is a letter indicating the selected frequency. (b) On the SELCAL encoder (GSE 094), send a code that is different from the aircraft code that you set in item (2) (a). NOTE: The signal of the SELCAL encoder (GSE 094) is transmitted through the VHF ground station. Result: 1 On the SELCAL annunciator panel, on the instrument panel, the VHF 2 light does not flash. (c) On the SELCAL encoder (GSE 094), send the same code as you sent in item (2) (a). Result: 1 On the SELCAL annunciator panel, on the instrument panel, the VHF 2 light flashes. 2 In the aural warning system, SELCAL is heard one time. (d) On the control wheel, set the PTT/HOT Mic switch to PTT. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 23-21-00 Page 3 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 Make sure that the VHF 2 light goes off. (e) Get a new transmission. Result: 1 On the SELCAL annunciator panel, on the instrument panel, the VHF 2 light flashes. 2 In the aural warning system, SELCAL is heard one time. (f) On the SELCAL annunciator panel, on the instrument panel, push the VHF 2 pushbutton. Result: 1 Make sure that the VHF 2 light goes off. (3) (This step is applicable only to the HF SELCAL system) Do the operational test of the SELCAL system with the HF transceiver as follows: NOTE: Make sure that the HF transmitter and the HF receiver are set to the AM mode and at the same frequency. (a) On the SELCAL decoder computer, use the code selection thumb wheel switches to set the aircraft code. NOTE: The SELCAL selection of codes is made by four knobs mounted on the front of the decoder. Above each knob there is a letter indicating the selected frequency. (b) On the SELCAL encoder (GSE 094), send a code that is different from the aircraft code that you set in item (2) (a).
