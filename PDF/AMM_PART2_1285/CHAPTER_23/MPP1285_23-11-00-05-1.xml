			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that the HF circuit breaker is closed. J. Procedures (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A EFFECTIVITY: AIRCRAFT WITH HF-230 SYSTEM • WARNING: DO NOT OPERATE THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY SYSTEM WHILE THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A HANGAR OR ADJACENT TO METAL BUILDINGS. THE RADIO FREQUENCY ENERGY THAT THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY ANTENNA TRANSMITS CAN BE DANGEROUS. TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONNEL, MOVE THE AIRCRAFT TO AN OPEN AREA. • DO NOT TRANSMIT WITH THE HF COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IF ANY AIRCRAFT IS REFUELING OR DEFUELING IN A RANGE OF 30 m (100 ft) FROM THE HF ANTENNA. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE APPROVED SAFETY STANDARDS AN EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR AND CAUSE INJURIES TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT. • WHEN THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY SYSTEM IS ON, PERSONNEL MUST STAY AT A SAFE DISTANCE, GREATER THAN 2.1 m (7 ft) FROM THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY ANTENNA. THIS IS THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LEVEL (MPEL) RADIUS. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE APPROVED SAFETY STANDARDS, INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (1) Do the test as follows: (a) Connect the wattmeter (50 watts minimum) between the power amplifier and the antenna coupler and adjust the wattmeter to measure the average forward power. (b) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, set the controls as follows: 1. Volume Control - OFF. 2. Squelch Control - TST. 3. Clarifier Control - OFF. 4. FREQ/CHAN switch - FREQ. 5. Mode Control - AM. (c) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, rotate the volume knob halfway. (d) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, adjust the clarifier control as necessary. (e) On the Pilot's and Copilot's Audio Control Panels, installed on the instrument panel, push the HF pushbutton to turn on the HF System. (f) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, adjust the volume knob until a background noise can be heard in the phones and on the loudspeakers. (g) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, slowly turn the SQUELCH knob clockwise.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result: 1 Make sure that the background noise disappears. (h) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, set the FREQ/ CHAN switch to FREQ and adjust the frequency to 2000.0 KHz. (i) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, turn the 1000.0 KHz FREQ/CHAN switch from 2000.0 thru 29999.9 KHz. Result: 1 Make sure that the tuning band changes correctly. NOTE: Listen for the operation noise of the tuning rotary solenoid of the power amplifier. Refer to this table to know at what frequency a band change must occur: Table 501 BAND FREQUENCY RANGE (KHz) BAND LIMITS (KHz) 1 2999.0 2000.0 - 2999.0 2 3999.0 3000.0 - 3999.0 3 5999.0 4000.0 - 5999.0 4 8999.0 6000.0 - 8999.0 5 13999.0 9000.0 - 13999.0 6 22999.0 14000.0 - 22999.0 7 29999.0 23000.0 - 29999.0 (j) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, adjust the frequency to 2000.0 KHz. (k) Momentarily push the PTT button. Result: 1 To make sure that the antenna coupler is tuned in, listen for operation of the variable capacitor and/or motor coil and relays inside the antenna coupler. 2 Make sure that a continuous audio tone is heard in the headphones and on the loudspeakers, when you do the antenna coupler tuning. 3 On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, make sure that a T comes into view in the lower right band corner of the control panel. WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE RF OUTPUT TERMINAL ON THE ANTENNA COUPLER, THE ANTENNA LEAD-IN WIRE, ON THE FEED THROUGH, OR THE ANTENNA ITSELF WHEN THE MICROPHONE IS ON. THIS CAN CAUSE DANGEROUS BURNS WHEN THE SYSTEM IS IN OPERATION. NOTE: Do the job cycle of 1 minute of transmission by 5.0 minutes of reception, during the test. (l) Do steps L and K again for the frequency ranges given in Table I. (m) On the CTL-230 control panel, on the Pull Mode knob, set the AM mode and adjust the frequency to 2000.0 KHz. (n) On the pilot's or copilot's control wheel, push the PTT and hold. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 23-11-00 Page 4 of 29 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (m) On Control Panel KCU-951, set the frequency to more than 3500.0 kHz. (n) On the pilot's or copilot's control wheel, momentarily push the PTT button. Result: 1 Make sure that Power Amplifier/Coupler KCA-952 is tuned in. For this, listen to make sure that the variable capacitor and/or the motor coil and relays operate inside the antenna coupler. 2 Make sure that a continuous audio tone is heard in the earphones or on the loudspeakers, while the Power Amplifier/Coupler tuning process occurs. The audio tone must stop in one second after the tuning cycle is completed. NOTE: The continuous audio tone during the tuning cycle is a common characteristic of the KHF system. It has a nonvolatile memory that stores the last 20 transmit frequencies. If one of this frequencies is tuned, no audio tone is produced. To produce the tone as described, use a frequency different from the ones recently used. (o) Do items (m) and (n) again for the bands contained in the table of item (k), from band 3 to band 6.

SEVERE RF BURNS CAN BE CAUSED IF YOU TOUCH THE ITEMS ABOVE, WHEN THE SYSTEM IS IN OPERATION. NOTE: Follow the job cycle of 1 minute of transmission and 5 minutes of reception, during the test. If the antenna coupler fails to be tuned in to a channel, an intermittent 1-KHz audio tone will be heard after approximately 45 seconds. (p) On Control Panel KCU-951, adjust the frequency. To do it, refer to the table of item (i). After the tuning cycle is completed, push and hold the PTT pushbutton. (q) Read the direct power indication on the wattmeter.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Procedures SUBTASK 720-004-A EFFECTIVITY: AIRCRAFT WITH HF-230 SYSTEM WARNING: • DO NOT OPERATE THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY SYSTEM WHILE THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A HANGAR OR ADJACENT TO METAL BUILDINGS. THE RADIO FREQUENCY ENERGY THAT THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY ANTENNA TRANSMITS CAN BE DANGEROUS. TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONNEL, MOVE THE AIRCRAFT TO AN OPEN AREA. • DO NOT TRANSMIT WITH THE HF COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IF ANY AIRCRAFT IS REFUELING OR DEFUELING IN A RANGE OF 30 m (100 ft) FROM THE HF ANTENNA. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE APPROVED SAFETY STANDARDS AN EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR AND CAUSE INJURIES TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT. • WHEN THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY SYSTEM IS ON, PERSONNEL MUST STAY AT A SAFE DISTANCE, GREATER THAN 2.1 m (7 ft) FROM THE HF - HIGH FREQUENCY ANTENNA. THIS IS THE MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LEVEL (MPEL) RADIUS. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE APPROVED SAFETY STANDARDS, INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR. (1) Do the test as follows: (a) On the HF-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, set the controls as follows: 1. Volume Control - OFF. 2. Squelch Control - TST. 3. Clarifier Control - OFF. 4. FREQ/CHAN switch - FREQ. 5. Mode Control - at USB. (b) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, rotate the volume knob halfway. (c) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, adjust the clarifier control as necessary. (d) On the Pilot's and Copilot's Audio Control Panels, installed on the instrument panel, turn the volume knob halfway and open the audio for the loudspeakers. (e) On the Pilot's and Copilot's Audio Control Panels, installed on the instrument panel, push the HF pushbutton to turn on the HF system. (f) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, adjust the volume knob until a background noise can be heard in the phones and on the loudspeakers. (g) On the CTL-230 control panel, installed on the control pedestal, slowly turn the squelch knob clockwise. Result: 1 Make sure that the background noise disappears.
