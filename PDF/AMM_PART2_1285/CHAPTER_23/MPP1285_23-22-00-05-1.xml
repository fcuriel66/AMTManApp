			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL ACARS - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH ACARS 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do the ACARS functional test. B. The ACARS functional test can be accomplished in two different ways: • With a Portable ACARS Test Station (PATS) ( AMM TASK 23-22-00-700-801-A/500). • With the help of an ACARS Ground Station ( AMM TASK 23-22-00-700-802-A/500). C. The ACARS (Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System) gives a two-way data link for air-to-ground communication which permits the airlines to connect their fleet with a ground- based service provider to exchange data such as pre-departured clearance, flight plans, weather information, messaging, times of arrival and departure, and other operational flight data. D. The ACARS installed is the UniLink UL-600 and use VHF 3 as the communication media between aircraft and ground stations. The system operates with the DUAL FMS and the pilot interface is accomplished to the FMS Control and Display Unit (CDU) (Figure 501). E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).
