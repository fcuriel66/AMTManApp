General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the V/UHF functional test. NOTE: When the V/UHF remote-control panel or V/UHF transceiver is replaced with a new or repaired unit, it is necessary to reconfigure the V/UHF system (AMM TASK 23-14-00-800-801-A/200) before starting this test. (2) When you do the V/UHF functional test, make sure the aircraft is not in or near a large metal structure. (3) The V/UHF remote control panels are installed on main control panel. B.

Test Procedures (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-003-A (1) Do the V/UHF automatic Power-on Built-in Test (PBIT) as follows: (a) On the V/UHF remote control panel, set the mode switch to the TR position. Result: 1 The check of the Software checksum is done and the display will show: CRC ok . . s t a r t i n g 2 Soon after the display will show: (xx.xx = current software version, Axx = valid TxRx address, if available (range 0 to 30)). V x x . x x ## # A x x 3 A built-in test is initiated. 4 An LED test is initiated. 5 After the PBIT, the last control unit with connected transceiver setting will show: P 1 2 U ↑ Am NOTE: When an error and/or warning message, e.g. BIT ERROR, appears and/or LED GO goes out, refer to the latest revision of ROHDE&amp;SCHWARZ - CONTROL UNIT (GB 6500) Operator's Manual 6075.9155.12.xx for more information. (2) Do the V/UHF Initiating the Built-in Test (IBIT) as follows: (a) On the V/UHF remote control panel, set the mode switch to the SET position. Between positions GD and SET you must pull the mode switch (safety lock). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 CONFIG-2 23-14-00 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
