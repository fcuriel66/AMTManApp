			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT UNIT (CMU) - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH CMU 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to do the CMU functional test. B. The CMU functional test can be accomplished in two different ways: • With a Portable ACARS Test Station (PATS) ( AMM TASK 23-24-00-700-801-A/500). • With the help of an ACARS Ground Station ( AMM TASK 23-24-00-700-802-A/500). C. The CMU gives a two-way data link for air-to-ground communication which permits the airlines to connect their fleet with a ground-based service provider to exchange data such as predeparture clearance, flight plans, weather information, messaging, times of arrival and departure, and other operational flight data. D. The CMU uses the VHF 3 as the communication media between aircraft and ground stations. The system operates with the FMS and the pilot interface is accomplished through the FMS Control and Display Unit (CDU). E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 23-24-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITH CMU 2. CMU - FUNCTIONAL TEST WITH A PORTABLE ACARS TEST STATION (PATS) A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the CMU functional test with a Portable ACARS Test Station (PATS). (2) The Portable Acars Test Station (PATS) is used to simulate an ACARS ground station, which permits a message to be sent from the PATS to the aircraft and from the aircraft to the PATS. (3) These procedures are applicable to aircraft with the baseline AMI (Airline Modifiable Information) database installed on the CMU. If the aircraft has a customized version of the AMI, the screens or line select keys sequences on the CDU may not match. NOTE: The figures show typical displays on the CDU. The display can show different information when customized AMI (Airline Modifiable Information) is loaded on the aircraft. B.
