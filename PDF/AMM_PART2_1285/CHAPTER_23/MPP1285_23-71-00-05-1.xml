			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Supply external DC power ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Connect the headset to the HEADPHONE (HEADSET) jack of the COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER MICROPHONE MONITOR panel. J. Voice Recording System - Test Procedures (Figure 501) (Figure 502) (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 740-002-A (1) Do the self-test of the system as follows: (a) Push the TEST pushbutton switch on the CVR MICROPHONE MONITOR panel, for 2 seconds. Result:  1 On the CVR MICROPHONE MONITOR panel, the STATUS light comes on for a second (GO indication). 2 A tone (800 Hz) is heard in the headset (successful self-test indication). 3 After a delay of 1 second (end of the self-test), the STATUS light goes off. 4 After a delay of 2 seconds, the tone (800 Hz tone) stops. NOTE: If the TEST pushbutton switch is kept pushed, a new self-test starts. 5 (AIRCRAFT WITH RECORDER INDEPENDENT POWER SUPPLY - RIPS) If the test fails (the status light does not come on and there is no tone), the RIPS unit must be also considered as a probable cause, because it is part of the voice recorder system. (2) Do the ERASE function as follows: (a) Put the wheel chock (GSE 012) on the landing gear wheels ( AMM TASK 10-10-01-500-801-A/200). (b) Set the parking brake to OFF (AMM SDS 32-44-00/1). (c) Set the WOW to the flight condition ( AMM TASK 32-63-00-860-801-A/200). (d) Push the ERASE pushbutton on the CVR MICROPHONE MONITOR panel, for 2 seconds and release it. Result:  1 There is no erase tone in the headset. (e) Set the WOW to the ground condition ( AMM TASK 32-63-00-860-801-A/200). (f) Push the ERASE pushbutton on the CVR MICROPHONE MONITOR panel, for 2 seconds and release it. Result:  1 There is no erase tone in the headset. (g) Set the parking brake to ON (AMM SDS 32-44-00/1). NOTE: Make sure that the parking brake pressure switch and the air/ground proximity switches show aircraft parked and aircraft on the ground.
