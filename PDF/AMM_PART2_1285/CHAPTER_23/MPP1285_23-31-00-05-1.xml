			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Remove the Maintenance Panel ( AMM TASK 31-17-01-000-801-A/400). J. Cabin Interphone - Adjustment (Figure 510)   (Figure 509)  SUBTASK 820-002-A NOTE: The PA/VOL and the PA/SENS potentiometers on the Maintenance Panel are already adjusted and safetied with lacquer on the assembly line, as shown below. If it is necessary to adjust them do the steps (1) and (2). • PA/SENS: Connector J7204, pins 1 and 2 with the most appropriate impedance as listed in table 501. • PA/VOL: Connector J7204, pins 4 and 5 with impedance between 20 and 70 Ω. (1) Adjust the PA/VOL potentiometer as follows: (a) On the Maintenance Panel, loosen the locking nut at the PA/VOL potentiometer. (b) Connect a digital ohmmeter across pin 4 and pin 5 of connector J7204. (c) Adjust the PA/VOL potentiometer until you get a value between 20 and 70 Ω. (d) With the lacquer, lock the PA/VOL potentiometer. (2) Adjust the PA/SENS potentiometer as follows: Table 501 - PA/SENS IMPEDANCE RANGES 40 to 80 Ohms 200 to 250 Ohms 450 to 500 Ohms (suggested) 700 to 750 Ohms 900 to 1000 Ohms 1250 to 1500 Ohms (a) On the Maintenance Panel, loosen the locking nut at the PA/SENS potentiometer. (b) Connect a digital ohmmeter across pin 1 and pin 2 of connector J7204. (c) Adjust the PA/SENS potentiometer until you get the most appropriate impedance as listed in table 501. (d) With the lacquer, lock the PA/SENS potentiometer. (3) Adjust the Attendant Headset Microphone Gain as follows: (a) Energize the aircraft with the External DC-Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (b) Close the aircraft main and service doors to prevent interference of external noise with the Passenger Address and Cabin Interphone System adjustment.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Adjust the gain of the flight attendant handset microphone. Use a small screwdriver to turn the potentiometer at the bottom of the flight attendant handset. First turn the screwdriver completely counterclockwise to cancel the microphone gain. (d) Keep the handset PTT pushed and make a voice announcement, while you increase the microphone gain with a slow movement of the screwdriver clockwise. Increase the microphone gain until you get the maximal audio volume for this respective flight attendant operation area, without audio microphone feedback. As a result, the voice announcement for the passengers must be clear and loud. (e) Do steps (c) and (d) again for each flight attendant handset installed in the aircraft. (f) As a check of the audio quality, make a voice announcement from the Pilot seat. Use the pilot's headset and hand-mike microphone. The voice announcement for the passengers must be clear and loud. (g) Do step above (f) again for the copilot and observer seats. The voice announcement for the passengers must be clear and loud. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Open the main door. (2) Install the Maintenance Panel ( AMM TASK 31-17-01-400-801-A/400). (3) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
