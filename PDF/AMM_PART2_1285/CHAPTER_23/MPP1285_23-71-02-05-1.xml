			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Rear electronic compartment I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Put the hydraulic platform (GSE 036) at the necessary height. (2) Open access door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Remove the underwater locator beacon ( AMM TASK 23-71-02-000-801-A/400). NOTE: • (AIRCRAFT WITH HONEYWELL CVR INSTALLED) If the date marked on the ULB is expired or almost expired, send the ULB back to the manufacturer for servicing. Refer to the last revision of Honeywell CMM 23-70-44. • (AIRCRAFT WITH L3 CVR INSTALLED) If the date marked on the ULB is expired or almost expired, send the ULB back to the manufacturer for servicing. Refer to the last revision of L3 CMM 23-70-04. (4) Make sure the ULB is clean and dry. J. CVR ULB - Operational Test (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do the test of the ULB battery as follows: (Figure 501) (a) (AIRCRAFT WITH TELEDYNE-BENTHOS ULB BATTERY) With a multimeter (GSE 050) (3), measure the voltage between the ULB case (1) and the water activation switch (2). If the battery voltage is below 6.00 V, replace the ULB (1) with a serviceable unit. (b) (AIRCRAFT WITH ULB BATTERY DIFFERENT FROM TELEDYNE-BENTHOS) With a multimeter (GSE 050) (3), measure the voltage between the ULB case (1) and the water activation switch (2). If the battery voltage is below 2.97 V, replace the ULB (1) with a serviceable unit. (2) Do the operational test of the ULB (1) as follows: (Figure 502) (a) Configure the Ultrasonic Test Set (GSE 605) (5) as follows: 1. Turn the GAIN knob (4) fully clockwise to turn the Ultrassonic Test Set (5) on and to select the maximum gain. 2. Turn the TUNING knob (7) to a setting between 35 and 40 kHz. 3. If available on the Ultrasonic Test Set model, set the INPUT switch to INT. (b) Use an electric lead (3) to establish a short-circuit between the ULB case (1) and the water activation switch (2). (c) Put the Ultrasonic Test Set (5) next to the ULB (1). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 23-71-02 Page 3 of 6 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Result:  1 The Ultrasonic Test Set (5) receives, through its microphone (8), the inaudible ultrasonic waves emitted by the ULB (1) and reproduces the signal as repetitive beeps through its speaker (6). NOTE: • In a setting between 35 and 40 kHz, adjust the TUNNING knob (7) as necessary to have the best signal. • Adjust the GAIN knob (4) as necessary for a comfortable listening level. (d) Remove the electric lead (3) to stop the short-circuit in the ULB (1). (e) Turn the GAIN knob (4) fully counterclockwise to turn the Ultrasonic Test Set (5) off. NOTE: • (AIRCRAFT WITH HONEYWELL CVR INSTALLED) If the test results are not satisfactory, send the ULB back to the manufacturer for servicing. Refer to the last revision of Honeywell CMM 23-70-44. • (AIRCRAFT WITH L3 CVR INSTALLED) If the test results are not satisfactory, send the ULB back to the manufacturer for servicing. Refer to the last revision of L3 CMM 23-70-04. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the ULB ( AMM TASK 23-71-02-400-801-A/400). (2) Close access door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Remove the hydraulic platform (GSE 036). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 23-71-02 Page 4 of 6 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
