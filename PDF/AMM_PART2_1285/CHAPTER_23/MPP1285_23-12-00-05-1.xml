			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 23-12-00-700-805-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 6. VHF - FUNCTIONAL TEST A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the functional test of the VHF radios. (2) A wattmeter is used to make sure that the direct and reflected powers are within acceptable values during transmission. A frequencymeter is also used to measure the transmission frequency and to make sure that it corresponds to the frequency selected on the RMU's. B.

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 A - Does the task Forward electronic compartment 1 B - Helps technician A In the cockpit I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-006-A (1) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • VHF 1 (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 1/COMM/VHF 1). • VHF 2 (Location Tip: DC BUS 2/COMM/VHF 2). • (Aircraft with VHF 3 Honeywell) VHF 3 (Location Tip: DC BUS 1/COMM/VHF 3). (3) Make sure that these systems are operational and on: • Airborne Audio System (AMM SDS 23-51-00/1). • Radio Management System (AMM SDS 23-81-00/1). (4) (PRE-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036) Make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (5) (POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036) Install the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). (6) Open access door 113CZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). J. VHF - Test Procedures (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 720-003-A (1) Install the wattmeter (6) (GSE 040) between the coaxial connector (5) and the coaxial adapter (2) located on the front pressure bulkhead, as follows (refer to Figure 505): (a) Connect the RF coaxial cable (1) to the wattmeter (6) and to the coaxial adapter (2).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Connect the RF coaxial cable (3) to the wattmeter (6) and to the coaxial adapter (4). (c) Connect the coaxial adapter (4) to the coaxial connector (5). (2) On the circuit breaker panel, remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag and close the VHF 1 circuit breaker. (3) On the pilot or copilot digital audio panel, push the COM1 pushbutton. (4) On RMU 1, select an operational frequency in the COM 1 window. (5) Push the PTT pushbutton to simulate a transmission. (6) Make sure that the direct power read on the wattmeter (GSE 040) is 14 W minimum. (7) Make sure that the frequency read on the test set (GSE 126 or GSE 301 or GSE 474) corresponds to the frequency selected on RMU 1. (8) Invert the element plug-in (GSE 042) of the wattmeter to measure the reflected power and push the PTT pushbutton to transmit. (9) Make sure that the reflected power read on the wattmeter is 10% maximum of the direct power measured previously. (10) Remove the Wattmeter. (11) Fill the internal part of the coaxial connectors (1) and (2) with Dow Corning No. 4 Lubricant Compound (WM 20-50-00). (12) Connect the coaxial cables again. (13) Do steps (1) to (8) again for VHF 2 (COM 2) and RMU 2. (14) (Aircraft with VHF 3 Honeywell enabled for voice communication) Do steps (1) to (8) again for VHF 3 (COM 3) and RMU 1. To set COM 3 on RMU 1, do as follows: 1. On RMU 1, push the PGE button. 2. Set SYS SELECT. 3. Select the 1/3 configuration on the RMU display. 4. Push the 1/2 button to select COM 3. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-006-A (1) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (2) Close door 113CZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) (POST-MOD. S.B.145-32-0036) Remove the safety pin of the NLG door solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200).
