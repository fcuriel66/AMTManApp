			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 The RMU power-on self-test starts. NOTE: If an error occurs during the Power-On Self-Test, an error message will be shown on the RMU display. (d) Set the MFD to the TCAS page. (e) Push the select key to set the RMU to the ATC/TCAS window. Result: 1 The cursor moves to stay around the data field related to that line select key. (f) With the select key, set the ATC/TCAS window to the TA/RA mode. (g) Push and hold the RMU TST function key. Result: 1 On the RMU, the ATC/TCAS window shows TEST and SYS TEST (amber). 2 The MFDs and PFDs show TCAS TEST (white). NOTE: If the TCAS is defective, the MFDs and PFDs show TCAS FAIL (amber). 3 The Aural Warning gives the TCAS TEST message. 4 The MFDs show a Traffic test pattern, which permits the check of each type of intruder symbol: • hollow blue diamond. • solid blue diamond. • solid amber circle. • solid red square. 5 On the PFDs, the VSI shows red and green arc zones. (h) At the end of the test cycle: Result: 1 The RMU shows a green ATC PASS indication. NOTE: If the transponder is defective, the RMU shows ATC ERROR (amber). 2 The Aural Warning gives the TCAS TEST PASS message. NOTE: If the TCAS is defective, the TCAS FAIL aural warning is heard, and the MFD and PFD show an amber TCAS FAIL indication. (i) Release the RMU TST function key. (j) On the RMU, push the SQ function key. Result: 1 The COM radio squelch opens and the noises or signals of the radios can be heard on the audio system. 2 The COM window shows the letters SQ (amber) along the top. (k) On the RMU, push the SQ function key. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 23-81-00 Page 4 of 11 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
