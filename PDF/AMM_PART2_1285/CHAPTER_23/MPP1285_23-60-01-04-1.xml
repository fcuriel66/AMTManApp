			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Let the remover touch the paint coat for 1 to 10 minutes. (c) Remove the layers with a wooden scraper. (d) Clean the surface with a clean cloth soaked in distilled water and wipe with a clean and dry cloth. (e) Clean the surface with a clean cloth soaked in methyl-ethyl-ketone or trichloroethane. NOTE: Do not put the cleaning cloth into the solvent because contamination of the container content can occur. (f) Wipe it with a clean dry cloth before the solvent becomes a gas. (4) To prepare metal surfaces with other coatings: (a) Sand the surface with sandpaper No. 180 until the coating is fully removed. (b) Clean the surface with a clean and dry cloth. (c) Clean the surface with a clean cloth soaked in methyl-ethyl-ketone or 1,1,1 trichloroethane. (d) Wipe it with a clean and dry cloth before the solvent becomes a gas. NOTE: Do not put the cleaning cloth into the solvent because contamination of the container content can occur. (5) (PRE-MOD SB145-23-0009) To prepare a metal surface with no coating: (a) Clean the surface with a clean cloth soaked in methyl-ethyl-ketone or 1,1,1 trichloroethane. (b) Wipe it with a clean and dry cloth before the solvent becomes a gas. (6) (POST-MOD SB145-23-0009) To prepare a metal surface with no coating: (a) Sand the surface with sandpaper No. 180 until the covering is fully removed. (b) Clean the surface with a clean and dry cloth. (c) Clean the surface with a clean cloth soaked in methyl-ethyl-ketone or 1,1,1 trichloroethane. (d) Wipe it with a clean and dry cloth before the solvent becomes a gas. NOTE: Do not put the cleaning cloth into the solvent because contamination of the container content can occur. (7) To prepare a surface in composite material: NOTE: Be careful not to cause damage to the metallic screen because the static discharger base will be bonded on it. (a) Sand lightly the surface with sandpaper No. 320 until you get to the metallic screen. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 23-60-01 Page 7 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Clean the surface with a clean and dry cloth. (c) Clean the surface with a clean cloth soaked in methyl-ethyl-ketone or 1,1,1 trichloroethane. (d) Wipe with a clean and dry cloth before the solvent becomes a gas. NOTE: Do not put the cleaning cloth into the solvent because contamination of the container content can occur. (8) Make a mark (3) on the structure around the static discharger base (4) contour at the correct mounting position. Obey the references of distance (1) and angles (2). NOTE: When the discharger (6) is connected to the base (4), the two must be in the flight direction (7). If the installation is not correct, there will be a larger force on it and the static discharger life time will decrease due to possibility of body rupture or base disengagement. (9) As a protection, apply neutral kraft paper (8) and adhesive tape (9) to the area around the static base (4). NOTE: Bond strength and durability are better if the surface is correctly prepared. J. Static Discharger Base - Bonding (Figure 402)  (Figure 403)  (Figure 404)  (Figure 405)  (Figure 406)  (Figure 407)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION: • (PRE-MOD SB 145-23-0009) DO NOT MIX THE ADHESIVE WITH THE ACTIVATOR BEFORE YOU APPLY THEM. • (POST-MOD SB 145-23-0009) BECAUSE THE TWO ADHESIVE COMPONENTS ARE BLACK, IT IS NECESSARY TO MIX THEM FOR 2 MINUTES MINIMUM. (1) (PRE-MOD SB145-23-0009) Do as follows: NOTE: There is no specific quantity for the application of the adhesive and activator. (a) Apply with the applicator brush a thin coat of the activator on the metallic screen (5) of the prepared surface. (b) Apply with spatula or knife a coat of adhesive on the contact surface of the static discharger base (4). (c) Put the static discharger base (4) in the position of the mark made on the structure (3) and apply a light pressure on it to cause some adhesive to come out. NOTE: After the installation, the adjustment time is 15 seconds and the handling strength time is 3 minutes. Do not remove the adhesive which came out not to move the static discharger base from its position. (d) Attach the static discharger base (4) with a clamp to a pressure between 5 and 20 psi.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: After you attach the clamp, do not move the bonding nor increase the pressure for 3 minutes (handling strength time). (e) The curing rate is fast, but let the adhesive cure for not less then 10 minutes. This will permit it to set before you install the static discharger (6) to the newly attached base (4). (f) After this time (10 minutes), remove the clamp. (2) (POST-MOD SB145-23-0009) Do as follows: NOTE: Adhesive squeeze pack is a pre-measured mix sufficient for the installation of up to 25 discharger bases. (a) Remove separator strip from squeeze pack and mix the contents of the pack together for about 2 minutes (usable life, 2 hours from mixing). (b) Cut the corner of the pack to squeeze adhesive onto bonding surfaces. (c) If supplied as bulk adhesive (in cans), use alternative mixing methods as follows: 1 Mix a ratio of 100 parts of resin component A to 15 (ÃÂ± 1) parts of hardener component B. (d) Apply a large quantity of adhesive to the base bonding pad, press firmly into position and attach (temporary), with metallic tape or other correct method. WARNING: IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THERE IS RISK OF EXPLOSION. USE ONLY AN EXPLOSION-PROOF HEAT GUN AND MAKE SURE IT IS SET TO A TEMPERATURE BELOW THE SELF-IGNITION TEMPERATURE OF THE FUELS ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT. NOTE: • We recommend the use of warm cure 50 to 70ÃÂ°C (122 to 158ÃÂ°F) for 2 hours. You can use a explosion-proof heat gun to get a fast cure time of 15 minutes. Set the explosion-proof heat gun at level 7 (check if the temperatures are between 150 and 200ÃÂ°C (302 and 392ÃÂ°F) to prevent a too hot condition) and position the tip at 10 cm from the static discharger base (4) on the opposite side of the surface where you applied the adhesive. • During fast cure, do not use too much heat because this will not let the adhesive harden (refer to MEP 09-058). Remove the adhesive tape only 1 hour after fast cure. Do not touch the static discharger base (4) during the cure time. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Do the functional check of the newly attached base ( AMM TASK 23-60-00-700-801-A/ 500). (2) (PRE-MOD SB145-23-0009) Prepare sealant PR 1440B2 to be applied along the edges of the bonded surface as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 23-60-01 Page 9 of 21 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Weigh the correct ratio (10:1) of the base compound and accelerator. Use only the quantity to be applied. (b) Mix the accelerator and base compound in their containers until you get an equal consistency. (c) Slowly put the accelerator into the base compound and mix for approximately 7 to 10 minutes. (3) (POST-MOD SB145-23-0009) Prepare the sealant PS 870B2 to be applied along the edges of the bonded surface as follows: NOTE: You can use adhesive (P/N 2-310 or ECCOBOND 60L) as an alternative to the sealant. Use the adhesive only when it is necessary to decrease curing time. Do not use the other adhesive alternatives (P/N 16307 or P/N 72-00008 or P/N 72-08116) as sealant. (a) Weigh the correct ratio (100:17) of the base compound and accelerator. Use only the quantity to be applied. (b) Mix the accelerator and base compound in their containers until you get an equal consistency. (c) Slowly put the accelerator into the base compound and mix for approximately 4 to 5 minutes. (4) To apply the sealant. NOTE: • At temperature of 24ÃÂ°C (75.2ÃÂ°F) and relative humidity of 50%, the application time is 2 hours, tack-free time is 36 hours, and curing time is 72 hours.  When the temperature increases from 5ÃÂ°C to 8ÃÂ°C (41ÃÂ°F to 46.4ÃÂ°F), the times decrease by half and when it decreases from 5ÃÂ°C to 8ÃÂ°C (41ÃÂ°F to 46.4ÃÂ°F), the times double. • (POST-MOD SB145-23-0009) Alternatively and only when it is necessary to decrease curing time, the adhesive (P/N 2-310 or ECCOBOND 60L) can be used in lieu of sealant with the same application of sealing. Do not use the other adhesive alternatives (P/N 16307 or P/N 72-00008 or P/N 72-08116) as sealant. (a) Hold the sealant-gun almost vertically to the surface. This will force the extruded sealant into the joint (discharge base-surface). (b) Apply pressure to the sealant-gun handle and move the sealant-gun along the surface to be sealed. (c) Use a spatula to make the new sealant coat stay in the applicable shape and smooth. (d) Let the sealant cure. (5) (PRE-MOD SB145-23-0009) Apply adhesive P/N EC1300L to the thread of the static discharger and stop for 10 minutes before you install it to its base.
