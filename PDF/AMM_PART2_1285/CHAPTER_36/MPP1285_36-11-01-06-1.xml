			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. General Visual Inspection of the Engine Bleed-Air Check Valves (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 212-002-A (1) Do a visual inspection of the valve for condition, which must include: (a) Check for general condition of the spring (if applicable), wear, breakage, load and correct assembly. (b) Integrity of the flappers. (c) Check on the hinge pin for too much clearance from the flapper and swaged areas. (d) Check on the pins for wear, deformation, signs of impact because of use and vertical play. (2) If a part of the check valve is damage, do AMM TASK 36-11-01-200-802-A/600. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the bleed-air check valves ( AMM TASK 36-11-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Install the upper cowling (AMM TASK 71-11-01-400-801-A/400).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Inspect (Detailed Inspection) Engine Low-Pressure Bleed-Air Check Valve SUBTASK 220-002-A (1) Examine the stop pin for wear, as follows: (a) Inspect the stop pin for wear at the LOC 1, LOC 2, LOC 3, and LOC 4 positions and record the smallest value measured at each location. Refer to Figure 602, DET. B and VIEW C. Result: 1 If the measured diameter across the stop pin is less than 4.52 mm (0.178 inch) in a location, replace the check valve with a new valve with the same configuration. 2 If the measured diameter across the stop pin is greater than or equal to 4.52 mm (0.178 inch) in all locations, install the check valve back. (2) Do the Flap Actuation Test, as follows: (a) Manually hold the engine bleed valve with the flap mounting surface in a vertical position. Refer to Figure 602, VIEW D. (b) Manually open one flap at a time to the full, open position. (c) Make sure that the flap assembly moves freely and does not bind up. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Install the bleed-air check valves ( AMM TASK 36-11-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Install the upper cowling (AMM TASK 71-11-01-400-801-A/400).
