			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task At the LH/RH pylons I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Keep the aircraft grounded ( AMM TASK 20-40-02-910-801-A/200). (2) Put the ladder in the work area. (3) Remove access panels 414CB and 424CB ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE BLEED-AIR SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ENGINE OR APU STOPS, BECAUSE OF THE HIGH BLEED-AIR TEMPERATURE. (4) Remove the fan-air valve filter (AMM TASK 36-11-03-000-802-A/400). NOTE: After you remove the valve filter, examine the filter housing for dirt and contaminants. If dirt or contaminants are found, clean the filter housing with a pneumatic vacuum device (AMM TASK 36-11-03-100-801-A/700), or other method that makes sure that no residues are left in the housing (AMM TASK 36-11-03-100-802-A/700). Use visual inspection aids as necessary to make sure that dirt and contamination are correctly removed. J. Cleaning of Fan-Air Valve Filter by Air Blast Method (Figure 702)  SUBTASK 170-002-A WARNING: USE EYE AND HAND PROTECTION WHEN YOU USE AN AIR SOURCE TO CLEAN. CONTAMINANTS CAN BECOME AIRBORNE AND CAUSE INJURY TO YOUR EYES AND HANDS. (1) Blow air at 25 psi maximum pressure from a regulated source of air to remove heavy contaminants. (2) Spray the fan-air valve filter with an electro-contact cleaning solution. (3) To remove the residual cleaning solution, let the filter air-dry or blow on it with a 25 psi maximum pressure from the air source. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Install the fan-air valve air filter (AMM TASK 36-11-03-400-802-A/400). (2) Install access panels 414CB and 424CB ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100).
