Repair the Thermal Insulation of the Duct Lines of Air Bleed System SUBTASK 350-002-A WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE BLEED-AIR SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ENGINES OR APU STOP BECAUSE OF THE HIGH BLEED-AIR TEMPERATURE. CAUTION: IF IT IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE A DUCT SECTION TO REPAIR THE THERMAL INSULATION, PUT PLASTIC PLUGS AT THE DUCT ENDS AS A PROTECTION. (1) Repair the ducts installed in the fuselage as follows (Figure 201): (a) Remove the damaged portion of the thermal insulation. (b) Apply a layer of ceramic fiber insulation to the part to be repaired. (c) Attach the duct ceramic fiber insulation with tape. Make sure that the part to be repaired is covered and attached with tape.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • On straight parts, use large tape. • On the curved parts, use narrow tape. (d) At the duct, wind tape around the ceramic fiber insulation, until the blanket is totally covered and attached. NOTE: The new turns must make correct overlaps on the old turns. (e) If the repair is at the tube end, do this procedure refer to sheet 2: NOTE: Do not apply tape on the tubular section of the flanges. 1 Use narrow tape. 2 Start the tape application on the second layer of large tape, and do one complete rotation parallel to the end of the insulation fiber layer. 3 Continue to apply the tape to the metallic surface of the tube, and do two complete rotations, while you hold the tape firmly. 4 Continue to apply the tape to the metallic surface of the tube, and do two complete rotations, while you hold the tape firmly. 5 Cut the tape and make sure that the tape end bonds well to the insulation. (2) Repair the ducts in the pylons and powerplant as follows (Figure 202): (a) Remove the damaged portion of the thermal insulation. (b) Apply a layer of ceramic fiber insulation to the part to be repaired. (c) Attach the ceramic fiber insulation with Teflon tape. (d) Cover the ceramic fiber insulation with fiberglass tape. Keep it attached to the duct and fully around it. (e) Apply a coat of red sealing compound and let it dry for 30 minutes, maximum, at an ambient temperature of 4 to 38ÃÂ°C (39.2 to 100.4ÃÂ°F) and a humidity of 75 ÃÂ± 15%. (f) Apply a second coat of the red sealing compound and let it to dry for 30 minutes, maximum, at an ambient temperature of 4 to 38ÃÂ°C (39.2 to 100.4ÃÂ°F) and humidity of 75 ÃÂ± 15%. (3) Repair the hydraulic cardboard sheet at the duct. To do this procedure, refer to (Figure 201), sheet 2, Detail B. (a) If necessary, repair the thermal insulation, as given in step (1). 1 Remove the damaged portion of the hydraulic cardboard sheet.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 Apply a new layer of hydraulic cardboard sheet to the part to be repaired. NOTE: When there is a small misalignment in the installation of the ducts ( AMM TASK 36-11-09-200-802-A/600), layers of hydraulic cardboard sheets can be applied to align them and reduce tension on the assembly. CAUTION: IF YOU APPLY TOO MUCH HYDRAULIC CARDBOARD SHEET TO THE DUCT, IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO INSTALL THE CLAMP. 3 Chamfer the edges of the hydraulic cardboard sheet and adjust its edges get good finishing. 4 Apply the hydraulic cardboard sheet as follows: • Each turn must correctly overlap the preceding one. 5 Firmly hold and apply adhesive tape to the hydraulic cardboard sheet. 6 Cut the tape and make sure that the end of the hydraulic cardboard sheet is correctly attached. (4) Repair the precooler outlet duct. To do this procedure, refer to Figure 202, sheet 1 and sheet 2: (a) Remove the damaged portion of the thermal insulation.
