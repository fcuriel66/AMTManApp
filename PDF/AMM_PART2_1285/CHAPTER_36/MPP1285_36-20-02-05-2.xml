			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL THERMAL SWITCH - ADJUSTMENT/TEST EFFECTIVITY: ACFT MODEL(S) EMB-135 1. General A. This section gives the procedure to do an operational check on the thermal switches (duct leakage switches and massive leakage switches). B. The duct leakage switches are installed at all flexible joints in the bleed lines and the massive leakage switches (in the region of the rear electronic compartment) are not installed at flexible joints in the bleed lines. C. There are 14 duct leakage switches for the RH bleed line and 17 duct leakage switches for the LH bleed line (On the APU bleed line are 3 duct leakage switches installed). D. There are 3 massive leakage switches (one for the LH bleed line, one for the RH bleed line, and one for the APU bleed line). E. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • The thermal switches identified by numbers 30, 32 and 34, are part of the APU Pneumatic System, which starts at the APU Bleed Air Check Valve and ends in the APU. NOTE: Refer to ATA 36 wiring manual (WM 36-21-50 and WM 36-21-51) for thermal switch electrical codes. (1) Do the check as follows: WARNING: BE CAREFUL WITH THE HIGH TEMPERATURE WHEN YOU HEAT THE THERMAL SWITCH. (a) With the aid of a heat gun and thermometer, slowly and continuously increase the temperature of the duct leakage switch of the LH bleed line with a heat gun, until you have a temperature higher than 91 ÃÂ± 3ÃÂ°C (195 ÃÂ± 5ÃÂ°F). NOTE: On the overhead control panel, make sure that the BLEED 1 pushbutton is pushed. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the BLD 1 LEAK warning message. 2 The master WARNING lights flash. 3 The LEAK indication, on the BLEED 1 pushbutton, comes on. (b) Push the master WARNING light. Result: 1 The master WARNING lights go off. (c) Let a plastic ice bag stay on the duct leakage switch, until the temperature of the switch decreases to below 79 ÃÂ± 3ÃÂ°C (175 ÃÂ± 5ÃÂ°F). (d) (POST-MOD. S.B.145-36-0030) On the overhead control panel, release the BLEED 1 pushbutton and press it again. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the BLD 1 LEAK warning message goes out of view. 2 LEAK indication on BLEED 1 pushbutton goes off. NOTE: Do the procedure for each duct leakage switch installed at the LH bleed line at a time. (e) With the aid of a heat gun and thermometer, slowly and continuously increase the temperature of the duct leakage switch of the RH bleed line with a heat gun, until you have a temperature higher than 91 ÃÂ± 3ÃÂ°C (195 ÃÂ± 5ÃÂ°F). NOTE: On the overhead control panel, make sure that the BLEED 2 pushbutton is pushed. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the BLD 2 LEAK warning message. 2 The master WARNING lights flash. 3 The LEAK indication, on the BLEED 2 pushbutton, comes on. (f) Push a master WARNING light. Result: 1 The master WARNING lights go off. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 CONFIG-2 36-20-02 Page 5 of 30 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
