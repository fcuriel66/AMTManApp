(3) Make sure that the engine is not in operation ( AMM TASK 71-00-01-910-804-A/200). (4) Use a workstand (or the multipurpose ladder) to get access to the APU bleed valve filter. (5) Remove the APU bleed-valve air filter ( AMM TASK 36-12-03-000-803-A/400). NOTE: After you remove the valve filter, inspect the filter housing for dirt and contaminants. If dirt or contaminants are found, clean the filter cavity with a pneumatic vacuum device, or other method, make sure that no residues are left in the cavity. Use visual inspection aids as necessary to make sure that dirt and contamination are correctly removed. J. Cleaning of the APU Bleed Valve Filter by Ultrasonic Method SUBTASK 130-002-A WARNING: DO NOT USE COMPRESSED OR SHOP AIR WITH A PRESSURE OF MORE THAN 30 PSIG TO CLEAN THE FILTER. USE OF GOGGLES OR A FACE SHIELD FOR EYE PROTECTION REQUIRED. DO NOT POINT THE AIR AT YOUR SKIN. FAILURE TO OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS, MAY RESULT IN PERSONEL INJURY AND OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. WARNING: DURING THE CLEANING PROCEDURE, DO NOT LET THE CLEANING SOLUTION TOUCH YOU AND DO NOT BREATHE ITS VAPORS OR MISTS. DO THE PROCEDURE IN AN AREA WITH A GOOD AIRFLOW.

CLEANING MATERIAL IS DANGEROUS AND, IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THESE PRECAUTIONS, INJURY CAN OCCUR. (1) To do the cleaning of the APU bleed-valve filter by ultrasonic method, do as follows: (a) Use safety goggles and gloves to do the cleaning. (b) Put the APU bleed-valve filter horizontally in a suitable container and put in a degreaser solution (Removegrax MLS-12E) at 135 to 145ÃÂ°F (57 to 63ÃÂ°C) for 15 minutes. (c) Remove the filter APU bleed-valve filter from the degreaser solution (Removegrax MLS-12E) and use a stiff bristle brush to loosen contamination on the inside of the filter. (d) Return the filter to the degreaser solution (Removegrax MLS-12E) at 135 to 145ÃÂ°F (57 to 63ÃÂ°C) for 15 minutes.

(f) Flush the APU bleed-valve filter from the outside to the inside with the Cleaner solution (alkaline aqueous cleaner 815MX ) at 135 to 145ÃÂ°F (57 to 63ÃÂ°C). (g) Immerse the APU bleed-valve filter in clean water at 110 to 120ÃÂ°F (43 to 49ÃÂ°C) for five minutes or spray it with warm water at 30 PSIG for a minimum of two minutes. (h) Put the APU bleed-valve filter horizontally in a clean, thermostatically controlled ultrasonic bath of the degreaser (Removegrax MLS-12E) at 135 to 145ÃÂ°F (57 to 63ÃÂ°C) for 20 minutes. (i) Rotate the APU bleed-valve filter at five minutes intervals. (j) Remove the APU bleed-valve filter from the bath and immediately immerse it in clean water at 110 to 120ÃÂ°F (43 to 49ÃÂ°C) for five minutes or spray it with clean warm water at 30 PSIG for a minimum of two minutes. (k) Dry the filter with clean filtered compressed or shop air. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 940-003-A (1) Install the APU bleed-valve filter ( AMM TASK 36-12-03-400-803-A/400).
