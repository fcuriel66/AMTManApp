Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A SAFE CONDITION BEFORE YOU DO THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. THIS IS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (1) Keep the aircraft grounded ( AMM TASK 20-40-02-910-801-A/200). (2) Put the ladder in the work area. (3) Remove access panels 414DB and 424DB ( AMM MPP 06-43-00/100). WARNING: DO NOT TOUCH THE BLEED-AIR SYSTEM DUCTS OR COMPONENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ENGINE OR APU STOPS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH BLEED-AIR TEMPERATURE. (4) Remove the Engine-Bleed Valve Air Filter ( AMM TASK 36-11-05-000-802-A/400). J. Cleaning of Engine-Bleed Valve Air Filter by Air Blast Method (Figure 702)  SUBTASK 170-002-A WARNING: USE EYE AND HAND PROTECTION WHEN YOU USE AN AIR SOURCE TO CLEAN. CONTAMINANTS CAN BECOME AIRBORNE AND CAUSE INJURY TO YOUR EYES AND HANDS. CAUTION: DO NOT USE METAL WOOL, METAL BRUSHES, OR ABRASIVES TO CLEAN PARTS. THESE MATERIALS CAN CAUSE SCRATCHES AND DAMAGE TO PARTS. DO NOT USE PAPER TOWELS TO DRY PARTS. PAPER TOWELS CAN LET CONTAMINANTS STAY ON PARTS, (1) Blow air at 25 psi maximum pressure from the regulated source of air through the engine-bleed valve air filter to remove contamination. WARNING: DO NOT LET PETROLEUM SOLVENT GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR SKIN OR EYES. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES FROM PETROLEUM SOLVENT. ALWAYS PUT ON GOGGLES, GLOVES, AND RESPIRATOR MASK WHEN YOU USE PETROLEUM SOLVENT CAN CAUSE INJURY TO YOUR SKIN, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. (2) Clean the engine-bleed valve air filter with an electro-contact cleaning solution or equivalent with petroleum solvent at ambient temperature for approximately 10 minutes. (3) To remove the remaining cleaning solution, let the air filter dry or blow it with a 25 psi maximum pressure from the source of air through the engine-bleed air filter.
