			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: • DO NOT APPLY TOO MUCH LUBRICANT TO THE O-RING. APPLY VERY LIGHT COATING OF LUBRICANT ONLY. THIS IS TO PREVENT THE O-RING TO GET TWISTED DURING INSTALLATION PROCEDURE. • DO NOT STRETCH THE PERFLUOROCARBON O-RING (POST-MOD S.B. 145-36-0015) NOT TO CAUSE ITS INSIDE DIAMETER TO BE EXPANDED BY MORE THAN 50% DURING INSTALLATION. • MAKE SURE THAT THE O-RINGS ARE CORRECTLY SEATED AND NOT TWISTED OR DAMAGED. (1) For assemblages where a Gamah flange/clamp joint is used, do as follows: Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, 3, 4 and 7. NOTE: • Refer to AMM TASK 36-11-09-400-801-A/400 for Gamah joint and duct installation. • If necessary, replace the insulation fiber layers ( AMM TASK 36-11-09-300-801-A/200). • Make sure that the ducts are correctly aligned ( AMM TASK 36-11-09-200-802-A/600). • You can correct a small mismatch in the assembly. To do this, add insulation fiber layers under the hydraulic-cardboard sheet ( AMM TASK 36-11-09-300-801-A/200) until the alignment is correct. • Make sure that the V-clamps are correctly installed. (Refer to AMM TASK 20-10-10-910-801-A/200). CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY TOO MUCH LUBRICANT TO THE O-RING. APPLY VERY LIGHT COATING OF LUBRICANT ONLY. THIS IS TO PREVENT THE O-RING TO GET TWISTED DURING INSTALLATION PROCEDURE. (a) Apply a thin layer of lubricant to the O-rings (5). (b) Install the O-rings (5) into the seal cavity of each flange, as follows: Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 7. NOTE: • If necessary, use the hook-end O-ring installation tool as an aid to do the O-ring installation. • Before you install the O-ring, cut the sharp point of the hook-end O- ring installation tool to prevent damage to the O-ring. 1 Put the O-ring in the space between the flanges of the two ducts. 2 Partially install the O-ring in the front portion of the flange groove. 3 With your index finger, hold the O-ring in the front portion of the flange and turn the O-ring until it partially fits into the rear portion of the flange groove. NOTE: • Make sure that the O-ring does not get twisted as you turn the O-ring. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 36-11-10 Page 16 of 20 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Keep your index finger holding the O-ring until the end of the installation. CAUTION: • FILE THE SHARP POINT EDGE FROM THE HOOK-END O- RING INSTALLATION TOOL. IF YOU DO NOT, DAMAGE TO THE O-RING CAN OCCUR. • BE CAREFUL NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE O-RING GROOVES AND TO THE INSIDE DIAMETER OF THE SLEEVE DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE O-RING WITH THE HOOK-END O-RING INSTALLATION TOOL. 4 Insert the hook-end O-ring installation tool between the flanges of the two ducts and capture the O-ring. 5 Use the tool to completely insert the O-ring into to the flange groove. (c) Remove excess lubricant from the tube flanges with a clean, lint-free gauze after the O-ring (5) installation. Do not remove the lubricant from the O-ring surface. (d) Visually examine the sleeve (6) for ovality. If you find ovality, discard the sleeve. NOTE: • If the internal diameter of the sleeve (6) is covered with Teflon dry lube, refer to S.B.145-36-0022 and remove the dry lube layer. • Make sure that the internal surface of the sleeve is clean and burnished. (e) With a clean, lint-free cloth, remove the excess lubricant from the external surface of the sleeve (6) and from the tube flanges. (f) Move the flanges sufficiently apart to slip the sleeve (6) over one flange end. Slide the sleeve (6) over the O-ring (5) of this flange sufficiently to permit the flanges to be aligned back to their original (Figure 401), sheet 4 - step 3), coaxial position with a satisfactory gap. Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 4 - step 1. NOTE: If you give a slight rocking motion on the sleeve, you will make its entry over the O-rings easier. (g) Pull the sleeve (6) back over the O-ring (5) of the other flange and center the sleeve; thus, each end of the sleeve (6) covers the inner shoulder of each flange. (h) With a clean, lint-free cloth, remove the excess lubricant from the external surface of the sleeve (6) and from the tube flanges. (2) For assemblages where a Gamah threaded coupling assembly is used, do as follows: Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 5, 6, and 7. NOTE: Refer to AMM TASK 36-11-09-400-801-A/400 (Figure 403, sheet 2) for Gamah coupling assembly and duct installation. CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY TOO MUCH LUBRICANT TO THE O-RING. APPLY VERY LIGHT COATING OF LUBRICANT ONLY. THIS IS TO PREVENT THE O-RING TO GET TWISTED DURING INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.
