(g) The pressure shown on the pressure gauge (GSE 250) must be between 2.4 to 3.1 psig. NOTE: • The pressure gauge must be read in the vertical position. • A pressure value of less than 2.4 psig is caused by leakage points in the system. • A pressure value higher than 3.1 psig is caused by a kinked, as clogged line or a fan air valve failure. (h) Repair as necessary and do the pressure test again and again until you have a satisfactory result. (i) Release the pressure in servo line duct and disconnect the pressure gauge (GSE 250). Refer to DET. C, Figure 502, sheet 3. (j) Disconnect the pressure gauge (GSE 116), and do as follows. Refer to DET. C, Figure 502, sheet 3: 1 For the left pylon, do as follows: 1.
