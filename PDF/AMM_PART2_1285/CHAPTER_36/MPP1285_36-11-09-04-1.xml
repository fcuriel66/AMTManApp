Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402) (Figure 404)  SUBTASK 420-002-A EFFECTIVITY: ASSEMBLAGE WITH GAMAH FLANGE/CLAMP JOINT WARNING: SOLVENTS AND CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE. A GOOD AIRFLOW MUST BE AVAILABLE WHEN YOU DO THE WORK IN CLOSED AREAS. PUT ON FACE MASKS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. NOTE: • It is permitted to correct a small mismatch in the assembly. To do this, add insulation fiber layers under the hydraulic-cardboard sheet ( AMM TASK 36-11-09-300-801-A/200) until the alignment is correct. (Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, DET. D and DETAIL - CORRECT ASSY). • Make sure that the V-clamps are correctly installed. (Refer to AMM TASK 20-10-10-910-801-A/200). (1) In an assembly where a Gamah flange/clamp joint is used, refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, DET. D and do as follows: (a) With the aid of a marking tool (Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, DET. S), mark the duct flanges with a porous-point marker (Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, DET. M). (b) Install the clamp(s) that attach(es) the duct (REF,) to the fuselage. Refer to (Figure 402), sheet 1, DET. E. (c) Install the new O-rings (5) and (6). Refer to AMM TASK 36-11-10-400-801-A/400. (d) Install the ducts with the Gamah joint (4) in position.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (e) Install the Gamah joint (4) over the sleeve (3), engage the latch mechanism on the joint, and snap it shut. NOTE: Make sure that the flange marks are visible under the Gamah joint edges. Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, as applicable. (f) Lockwire the clamp of the Gamah joint. Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, DET. J. (g) Lockwire the Gamah joint. Refer to (Figure 401), sheet 2, DET. J and DET. K. CAUTION: BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE BLANKET, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SLEEVES AND TIE-DOWN STRAPS ARE INSTALLED CORRECTLY. (h) (For A/C POST-MOD. S.B. 145-36-0048 or/and A/C POST-MOD. S.B. 145-36-0049) Install the blanket (REF.) to the Gamah joint (4). 1 Put the blanket in position as shown in (Figure 401), sheet 2. Adjust the opening of the blanket that overlaps the opening of the sleeve. 2 NOTE: Make sure that the blanket rim is fully over the thermal insulation. Apply the velcro fastener as shown in (Figure 401), sheet 2. 3 After blanket installation NOTE: • Make sure that the opening of the blanket overlapping is turned to the thermal switches used to detect bleed air leakage. • Make sure that the blanket rim is fully in contact with the thermal insulation. (2) in AN assemblY where a Marman V-clamp is used, refer to (Figure 402), sheet 1, DET. C. (a) For correct installation of V-clamps, ref. to AMM TASK 20-10-10-910-801-A/200. Install the ducts with the Marman V-clamp as follows: 1 Install the duct with the Marman V-clamp in position. 2 Install the Marman V-clamp (1). CAUTION: BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE BLANKET, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SLEEVES AND TIE-DOWN STRAPS ARE INSTALLED CORRECTLY. (b) (For A/C POST-MOD. S.B. 145-36-0048 or/and A/C POST-MOD. S.B. 145-36-0049) Install the blanket (REF.) to the Gamah joint (4). 1 Put the blanket in position as shown in (Figure 401), sheet 2. Adjust the opening of the blanket that overlaps the opening of the sleeve. 2 NOTE: Make sure that the blanket rim covers the thermal insulation fully.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 3 After blanket installation NOTE: • Make sure that the opening of the blanket overlapping is turned to the thermal switches used to detect bleed air leakage. • Make sure that the blanket rim is fully in contact with the thermal insulation. (c) Install the clamp(s) that attach(es) the duct (REF.) to the fuselage. Refer to (Figure 402), sheet 1, DET. E and W. NOTE: • You can use hydraulic-carboard sheets to correct misalignment in the duct assemblies. Refer to (Figure 402) sheet 1, DET. E . • Make sure that the ducts are aligned and assembled without tension. (3) In assemblies where a Marman V-clamp is used to join the cross bleed valve, refer to (Figure 402), sheet 1, DET. H and do as follows: (a) Remove the plastic protective caps from the ducts. (b) Put the duct (6) in position. (c) Install the duct (6). (d) Install the bolt (4) and washers (5) to the support (REF.).
