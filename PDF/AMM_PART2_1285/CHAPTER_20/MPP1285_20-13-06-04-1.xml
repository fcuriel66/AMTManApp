(6) Make sure that the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches, on the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, are set at OFF. (7) Attach a DO-NOT-SET-AUTO tag to the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches. (8) Open access panel 113DL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (9) Cut the lockwire from the power connector of the main batteries. (10) Disconnect the power connector from the main batteries. (11) Remove the backup battery ( AMM TASK 24-35-01-000-801-A/400). J. Removal (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 020-002-A (1) Get access to the related circuit breaker through the applicable compartment. (2) Hold the circuit breaker (1) and remove the nut (4) and lock washer (5) which attach the circuit breaker (1) to the panel (3). (3) Push the circuit breaker button (2) through the panel (3). (4) Remove the keyway washer (6). CAUTION: MAKE MATCH MARKS ON ALL THE ELECTRICAL WIRES OR CABLES BEFORE YOU DISCONNECT THEM. INCORRECT CONNECTION OF WIRES OR CABLES WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT. (5) Remove the two screws (8) and two lock washers (9) which attach the electrical wire(s) (7) and/or connection bar(s) (10) to the circuit breaker (1). NOTE: If the connection bar(s) (10) is attached to other circuit breaker(s), that make it not possible to remove the related circuit breaker (1), remove the two screws and the two lock washers that attach the connection bar (10) to these CBs. (6) Remove the circuit breaker (1). (7) Protect all the electrical wires or cables disconnected.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Put the circuit breaker (1) in its installation position. (4) Tighten the lock washer (5) and nut (4) which attach the circuit breaker (1) to the panel (3). CAUTION: YOU MUST CORRECT THE TORQUE VALUES IF THE TORQUE WRENCH ADAPTER IS AT AN ANGLE DIFFERENT FROM 90 DEGREES IN RELATION TO THE TORQUE WRENCH. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (5) Use the torque wrench to torque the nut (4) to 4.52 N.m (40 lb.in). (6) Apply drop of torque seal F-925 to the nut (4) as a check mark. (7) Remove the all protections from the electrical wires or cables disconnected. CAUTION: REFER TO THE MATCH MARKS MADE DURING THE REMOVAL WHEN YOU CONNECT THE ELECTRICAL WIRES OR CABLES. INCORRECT CONNECTION OF WIRES OR CABLES WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT. (8) Put the electrical wire(s) and/or connection bar(s) (10) in their installation position. (9) NOTE: If other(s) circuit breaker(s) has (have) been removed from the connection bar(s) (10), install and tighten the two screws and lock washers that attached it (each of them). Tighten the two screws (8) and two lock washers (9) which attach the electrical wire(s) (7) and/or connection bar(s) (10) to the circuit breaker (1). NOTE: If you are connecting the electrical wire to a connection bar or two electrical wires with the same screw, you must replace the screw with one 7.938 mm (0.312 in) long. CAUTION: YOU MUST CORRECT THE TORQUE VALUES IF THE TORQUE WRENCH ADAPTER IS AT AN ANGLE DIFFERENT FROM 90 DEGREES IN RELATION TO THE TORQUE WRENCH. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THIS PRECAUTION, DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT CAN OCCUR. (10) Use the torque wrench to torque each screw (8) to 1.69 N.m (15 lb.in). (11) Apply drop of torque seal F-925 to each screw (8) as a check mark. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Connect the power connector to the main batteries.
