			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL ELECTRICAL BONDING - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES EFFECTIVITY: ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to electrically bond/ground aircraft components and pieces of equipment to: (1) Protect the aircraft and personnel against lightning discharge hazards. (2) Reduce electromagnetic interference in radio transmission and reception. (3) Prevent the buildup of static charges between parts of the aircraft structure. (4) Make power current return paths. (5) Prevent development of RF potentials. (6) Protect persons against shock hazards. (7) Make fault current return paths. B. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 20-13-21-210-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. ELECTRICAL BONDING MAP - STANDARD PROCEDURES A. General (1) This task gives the procedure to identify the primary bonding jumpers and doors bonding jumpers on the aircraft. (2) The bonding jumpers are used as a very low resistance path for the current, from one part of the aircraft structure to another. They protect the aircraft against direct and indirect effects of lightning strike, EMI and ESD. (3) The bonding jumpers are installed on doors, fairings access doors and panels, flight control surfaces, landing gear and other external surfaces on the aircraft. (4) Some bonding jumpers are required, but not essential for all flights. The aircraft can be dispatched without some of these bonding jumpers. In this case, follow the maintenance instructions on this task. These bonding jumpers are classified as: NOTE: In case of pilot report about noise on radio communication, it is possible that one of the causes can be the the damaged bonding jumper.

(2) Do this task with the aid of a GSE 567 (or GSE 045), unless for fuel system components installed in the fuel tank. (3) For fuel-related components, do the procedure to make the aircraft safe for maintenance of the fuel system ( AMM MPP 28-00-00/200). WARNING: OBEY THE PURGING AND FUEL TANK ENTRY PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS OR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT ( AMM MPP 28-00-00/200). (a) For components installed in the fuel tank, do the steps that follow: WARNING: USE ONLY GSE 425 FOR THE ELECTRICAL BONDING CHECK. IF YOU USE A DIFFERENT GSE, A FIRE OR COMBUSTION CAN OCCUR. 1 Do this task with the aid of a GSE 425. 2 Make sure that the aircraft is deenergized. 3 Let an air flow through the tanks to decrease the concentration of fuel vapors. 4 Keep the fuel-vapor concentration levels in the fuel tank below 10% lower explosion limits (LEL). 5 Keep the oxygen levels in the fuel tanks between 19.5% and 23.5% by volume. 6 Make sure that the point where you will do the test is dry. (4) Disconnect the external DC power supply from the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (5) Get access to the point where you will do the test. (6) Use the ground bracket nearest to the point at which you will do the measurement. (7) If necessary, open access 113DL to use the ground point at the battery compartment AMM MPP 06-41-01/100.

Before the RHODIASOLVE E-23 solvent evaporates, dry these items with a clean dry cloth. NOTE: Do not touch the surfaces after you clean them. 4 Do the bonding immediately. (k) Method 12: Antenna base in contact with the skin - when you bond the antenna, you must let its base touch the fuselage skin. You must prepare the skin surface and the antenna base surface. Refer to the antenna removal/installation procedures in the AMM. NOTE: The conductive-gel gaskets installed between the aircraft skin and the antennas are an effective barrier against corrosion. Thus, the surfaces prepared for bonding have a longer life. The metal mesh in the gasket gives an electrical bonding, which dissipates static charges and lightning strikes. The gel sealant is a very good interface sealing. 1 With a SCOTCH BRITE TYPE A sponge, remove the old Alodine from the skin surface and antenna base surface. 2 With a clean cloth soaked in RHODIASOLVE E-23 solvent, clean the aircraft areas which you prepared for bonding.

Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task AR H. Protection of the Electrical Bonding Surfaces SUBTASK 910-004-A (1) Do the protection of the surface around the bonding assembly as follows: (a) Parts without finish (titanium, stainless steel, bronze) and anodized aluminum parts - Apply NYCOTE 7-11-DARK BLUE varnish to all the bonding assembly. Refer to Figure 222, Figure 223, Figure 224, and Figure 225. (b) Parts exposed to SKYDROL LD-4 hydraulic fluid and/or to aggressive environmental conditions (high level of humidity and contaminations) - Apply sealant PR1440B2 along the contour of the bonding assembly and on all rivets. After the sealant curing time, apply NYCOTE 7-11-DARK BLUE varnish on the sealant surface and other areas. Refer to Figure 226.
