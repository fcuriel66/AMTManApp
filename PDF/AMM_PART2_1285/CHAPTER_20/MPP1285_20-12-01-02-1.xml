CAUTION: PROTECT ACRYLIC AND OTHER PLASTIC TRANSPARENCIES TO PREVENT DAMAGE FROM METHYL ETHYL KETONE. (1) Wipe the receiving area with a cloth moist with methyl-ethyl-ketone or trichloroethylene to remove dirt, such as dust, grease, oil, or other contaminations. (2) Dry the area with a clean, dry cloth, before the solvent is dry. NOTE: The cleaned surface must be 5 mm wider than the decal area. I. Application SUBTASK 930-009-B CAUTION: APPLY THE DECALS AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OF 16ÃÂ°C (60.8ÃÂ°F) TO 38ÃÂ°C (100.4ÃÂ°F) AND (30 TO 75%) OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY. (1) Prepare the area for sticking. (2) With a soft pencil, mark the correct position where the decal will be applied. (3) For the correct installation of the polyester decal that gives the instructions for installation of non-magnetic bolts, refer to Figure 201. (4) Remove the liner protection of the decal. (5) Position the decal and press it over the surface, from one of the edges, with the aid of a plastic spatula. (6) Lightly and carefully use a plastic spatula on the decal to remove possible air bubbles, wrinkles, and rumples. (7) For overhead bin placards, apply silicone sealant RTV 780 (white) around the edges of the placards after they are installed. (8) If you see air bubbles under the decal after application, make a hole with a needle in the bubble edge and push the area with the thumb to keep the surface completely smooth and uniform.
