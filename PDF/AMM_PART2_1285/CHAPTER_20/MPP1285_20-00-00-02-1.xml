Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task On the aircraft I. Circuit Brakers Not applicable. J. Ramp Maintenance Procedures (1) For the ramp maintenance procedure, do as follows: WARNING: DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE LG SAFETY PIN, PREVENT SUDDEN AND STRONG MOVEMENTS OF THE AUXILIARY BRACE STRUT. THIS CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL UNLOCKING OF THE LANDING GEAR, WITH SUBSEQUENT INJURIES TO PERSONNEL AND DAMAGE TO AIRCRAFT. (a) Install the LG safety pin in the main and nose landing gear ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). (b) Put the chocks GSE 012 against the landing gear wheels. Refer to Figure 201. CAUTION: IF THE BRAKES ARE TOO HOT, WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE COOL TO SET THE PARKING BRAKE; OTHERWISE THE BRAKE DISCS CAN BOND TOGETHER. (c) Set the emergency/parking brake to the PARKING position. NOTE: To prevent freezing of the brakes, do not apply the parking brakes in cold weather conditions. CAUTION:THE RELATED MODULE OR UNIT, CONTAINS ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE SENSITIVE (ESDS) ITEMS. OBEY THE APPROVED INDUSTRY PRECAUTIONS WHEN YOU REMOVE, INSERT PARTS OR ASSEMBLIES. DAMAGE CAN OCCUR FROM ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE. (d) When you work with electronic equipment, obey the ESD rules. Refer to (AMM TASK 20-40-00-910-801-A/200). (e) When you work on or around the EWIS components, do the following procedure: • WM 20-21-00, Preventive Maintenance for EWIS - (Protection and Caution Recommendations). NOTE: You must do these procedures, to obey the "Protect and Clean As You Go" philosophy. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 910-801-A/200 20-00-00 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING:MAKE SURE THAT THE PITOT SENSORS, STATIC PORTS, TAT SENSORS, AOA SENSORS AND ICE DETECTOR HEATERS ARE SET TO OFF AND ARE COLD. TAKE CARE NOT TO TOUCH THESE COMPONENTS WHEN THEY ARE HOT. IF YOU TOUCH THEM, THEY WILL CAUSE INJURY TO YOU. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE PITOT SENSORS, STATIC PORTS, TAT SENSORS, AOA SENSORS AND ICE DETECTOR HEATERS ARE SET TO OFF AND ARE COLD BEFORE YOU PUT COVERS ON THEM. IF PROTECTIVE COVERS ARE INSTALLED AND YOU NEED TO PERFORM TESTS THAT SIMULATE "IN-FLIGHT CONDITIONS" OR SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE HEATING CAN BE TURNED ON, THESE COVERS MUST BE REMOVED TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THEM. (f) If necessary to open the circuit breakers of these components, do as follows: 1 Pitot sensors. Refer to ( AMM TASK 34-13-01-000-801-A/400). 2 Static ports. Refer to (AMM TASK 21-31-07-000-801-A/400). 3 Total-air-temperature (TAT) sensors. Refer to (AMM TASK 34-15-03-000-801-A/ 400). 4 Ice detectors.

(g) Keep the area around the aircraft free from residues, grease, oil, and fuel. (h) Use correct containers to collect/drain fluids. (i) Use approved platforms to get access to the aircraft. K. Hangar Maintenance Procedures (1) For the hangar maintenance procedure, do as follows: WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE DOOR BARRIER STRAP IS INSTALLED WHEN NO WORKSTAND IS PUT BELOW THE DOOR. IF THE BARRIER STRAP IS NOT INSTALLED, A PERSON CAN FALL FROM THE AIRCRAFT AND INJURIES CAN OCCUR TO HIM OR HER. (a) Install the door barrier strap when no workstand put below the door. (b) For aircraft PRE-MOD SB 145-32-0036, make sure that the pressure in hydraulic system 1 is fully released ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (c) For aircraft POST-MOD SB 145-32-0036, install the the safety pin of the NLG doors solenoid valve (AMM TASK 32-00-02-910-801-A/200). WARNING: DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE LG SAFETY PIN, PREVENT SUDDEN AND STRONG MOVEMENTS OF THE AUXILIARY BRACE STRUT. THIS CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENTAL UNLOCKING OF THE LANDING GEAR, WITH SUBSEQUENT INJURIES TO PERSONNEL AND DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT.

(r) If possible, do the maintenance procedures in an isolated area. Let a radius of at least 3 meters from other aircraft. (s) Keep the area around the aircraft free from residues, grease, oil, and fuel. (t) Use correct containers to collect/drain fluids. (u) Use approved platforms to get access to the aircraft. WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE LANDING GEAR COMPARTMENT. (v) Put protection fence or guards around the applicable area during retraction or extension of the landing gear. (w) If during the maintenance procedures an engine run-up is necessary, obey the safety precautions as given in the ( AMM MPP 71-00-00/200). (x) Put “NO SMOKING” placards around the maintenance area. Refer to Figure 201. L. Aircraft Restoration Procedures for Maintenance Services - Maintenance Practices (1) To restore the aircraft after ramp maintenance procedure, do as follows: (a) Remove the platforms, safety devices, tools, other equipment and unwanted materials from the work area. (b) Remove the items used for the EWIS components protection. NOTE: • After you finish the maintenance activities, make sure that there is no sign of contamination in the EWIS components. If contamination is found, refer to WM 20-21-00, Harness Cleaning Procedure. • You must do these procedures to obey the "Protect and Clean As You Go" philosophy.
