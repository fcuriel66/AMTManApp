			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 20-10-03-300-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. TUBING - REPAIR A. General (1) This procedure gives the instructions to repair tubing. CAUTION: • DO NOT USE TITANIUM FITTINGS IN REPAIRS IN THE OXYGEN SYSTEM TUBING. • HYDRAULIC TUBES INSTALLED BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR PRESSURE BULKHEADS MUST BE REPAIRED WITH NO SEPARABLE FITTINGS ONLY. • DO NOT USE FITTING NUTS TO PULL THE FITTINGS INTO ALIGNMENT. STRESSES APPLIED TO FITTINGS WILL CAUSE LEAKAGE, BLOWOFF, AND OTHER FAILURES. (2) When you form-repair sections, get the correct alignment of tubing and fittings to make the fittings stay against the two ends of the repair section. (3) Tubing can be reworked if the procedures written in this section are obeyed. A damaged tubing can be replaced or repaired. The repair can be made with a tube splice or with a fitting, if the damaged area is sufficiently small. For tubing repair, these instructions must be obeyed: (a) At the tube removal, it is most important not to change the tubing bends because this can change the bend ovality and cause cracking in the tube. (b) If the tubing must be bent, the bending is to be done in the ovality limits, recommended radius, wrinkle depth, and scratch depth, as shown in Figure 801, Figure 802, and Figure 803. (c) Dents or chafed areas must not be reworked. The tube or section must be replaced if the defect depth is more than the values given in Figure 804. For tubes with defects below these values, rework or replacement is not necessary. Times between inspections must be as recommended in the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD). (4) Tubing repairs are made with the replacement of a damaged tube section. The damaged section is cut out and replaced with a pre-assembled fitting/tube assembly or a union fitting. (5) Tubing repairs must be made with tube sections of the same tubing material and gauge as specified in Figure 805. Splice repairs can be made as shown in Figure 806. (a) In the fuselage interior, use only no separable fittings. (b) In the landing gear compartment, do not use aluminum tubes. (6) The aircraft is factory-equipped with flareless tubes TI-3AL-2.5V, 21-6-9, and 6061T6, Permaswage fittings, and Sierracin sleeves. (a) When a repair is made, tubes TI-3AL-2.5V may possibly be replaced with tubes CRES 304 annealed or 304 1/8 HARD or 21-6-9.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Sierracin sleeves can be replaced with sleeves MS21922, Permaswage, or Rynglok sleeves, and repair "H" fittings, when the sleeve or fitting agrees with the tube, as specified in Figure 805 and Figure 806. (7) Tube section repairs are of three categories, which are related to the location and the length of damage: (a) Replacement of a tube end-section with a flareless end-fitting than can be moved apart by the installation of a pre-assembled fitting assembly. Refer to Figure 807. (b) Replacement of a tube center section with a short damage segment, which can be repaired by the installation of a single union. Refer to Figure 808. (c) Replacement of a tube center section with large damage by the installation of a pre assembled fitting assembly. Refer to Figure 809. (8) Refer to AMM MPP 06-41-01/100, AMM MPP 06-41-02/100, AMM MPP 06-42-00/100, AMM MPP 06-43-00/100, and AMM MPP 06-44-00/100 for the access to the tubing. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) This method is recommended for 35235V flareless sleeve installation on 21- 6-9 and TI-3AL-2.5V tubes. Refer to Figure 805. (b) For the use of this method, obey the recommendation given in this section and the instructions written in the swaging kit. (4) Permaswage and Rynglok Methods CAUTION: • PERMASWAGE FITTINGS MUST NOT BE USED ON OXYGEN SYSTEM LINES. • RYNGLOK FITTINGS MUST BE USED ON HYDRAULIC SYSTEM LINES ONLY. (a) These methods are recommended for aluminum permanent unions on 6061-T6 tubing, and steel unions on 6061-T6, 21-6-09, TI-3AL2.5V, and 304 1/8 H tubing. Refer to Figure 805. (b) For the use of these methods, obey the fitting manufacturer's instructions. NOTE: • If you have leakage at the Permaswage fitting, you can swage it one more time only. • For the Permaswage fitting re-swaging, if possible, put the tool in the 45ÃÂ° position to the first swage marking. (5) "H" Fitting CAUTION: "H" FITTINGS MUST NOT BE USED ON OXYGEN SYSTEM LINE. (a) This fitting is an approved method for permanent repair of hydraulic lines for which no special tooling is necessary. Usual tool boxes contain all that is necessary for tube preparation and fitting assembly. The repair "H" fitting was approved for use on aluminum and stainless (low and high strength) tubing 21-6-9 cres, 304 1/8 hard cres, 304 annealed cres, and 6061-T6 aluminum. NOTE: The maximum gap between tube ends for the installation of "H" fitting is 0.250 inch. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove from the work area all tools, materials, and equipment that you used. (2) Make sure that the area is clean. (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the applicable system circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (4) Pressurize the related system and obey the applicable procedures to do a check for leaks. NOTE: Most of the hydraulic lines can be pressurized on ground by pressurizing the related hydraulic system (1 or 2).

The repair tube end section has been fabricated by roller swaging 35235 VN or 35235V flareless sleeves to the tube ends and tightening to a MS21902 flareless union on one end. STEP 1: Measure repair tube assembly total length C1 (figure 805). STEP 2: Observe cutout length C2 formula (C1 minus 2A) in table above. STEP 3: Determine "A" value for tube size in figure 811. STEP 4: Subtrac ("A" times 2) from measuring C1 for cutout length C2. 145AMM200037.MCE B EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 20-10-03 Page 17 of 18 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
