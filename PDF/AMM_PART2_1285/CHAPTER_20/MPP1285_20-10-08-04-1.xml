			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES OF MEK. DO WORK IN A WELL- VENTILATED AREA. DO NOT GET MEK IN EYES OR SKIN. USE APPROVED PROTECTION. KEEP MEK AWAY FROM SPARKS, FLAMES, AND HEAT. (1) Use a clean lint-free cloth soaked in MEK to clean the hole in the fitting and the surfaces of the bearing and bushing housing. (2) Apply a thin coat of corrosion-inhibiting compound (COR-BAN 27L) to the hole in the fitting and to the surfaces of the bearing and bushing. (3) Use a hand-operated press to install the bearings and bushings into their fittings. NOTE: • The bearings installed in areas lubricated with system fluids, such as hydraulic fluids and lubricants, must have their surfaces and interfaces protected with the same system fluid. • Do not apply corrosion-inhibiting compound to the above bearings. • You must apply force slowly and parallel to the wall of the bearing housing. This will prevent damage to the bearing housing. • Some fittings with bearings and bushings must be put on a workbench for complete assembly. You can then use a hammer and a punch with the same diameter as that of the bearings and/or bushings. (4) Lock the bearings in their housings with the retaining rings, if necessary. CAUTION: DO NOT REMOVE MORE MATERIAL THAN THE EXTERNAL LIP OF THE BEARING. DAMAGE TO THE FITTING CAN OCCUR. (5) After installation and when necessary, swage the bearings and bushings. Obey the correct swaging process (Table 401, Figure 402, and Figure 403). Table 401 - SWAGING PROCESSES PROCESS DESCRIPTION Type I Split sleeve with one swaging face.

(6) After the swaging is completed, make sure that the dimensions obey the limits (Figure 407). (7) Clean excess corrosion-inhibiting compound. (8) Use a needle file to remove excess material and residues from the bushings. NOTE: If necessary, remove burrs and break sharp edges. (9) After you complete the type-I our Type-II swaging process (Table 402), you must roll- swage the bearings to axially retain them in their housings. Refer to Table 405 , Figure 407, Figure 408, and Figure 409. NOTE: • The installation tool rotor must be coupled to a column and/or radial drilling machine. The peripheral speed for the balls of the swaging tool must be approximately 15 m/min up to 16 m/min. • You can find the drilling machine rate if you divide 5080 (constant) by the bearing outside diameter (dimension given in millimeters). (10) Apply the roll-swaging force slowly, with the installation tool, while the rotor rotates on the bushings, until the swaged material fully fills the chamfers of the bearing housing. CAUTION: CONTINUOUSLY APPLY COMPRESSED AIR BLASTS AND LUBRICATE THE INSTALLATION TOOL BALLS WITH AEROSHELL 7 GREASE TO PREVENT OVERHEATING OF THE SWAGED AREA. (11) For the roll-swaging of the bearings and bushings, do as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 20-10-08 Page 8 of 18 Rev 50 - Apr 29/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
