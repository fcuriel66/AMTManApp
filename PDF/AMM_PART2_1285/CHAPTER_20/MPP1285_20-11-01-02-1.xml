			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL  (Continued) SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION QTY (BRAND) Commercially available Cloth which does not release lints AR Commercially available Crocus Cloth No. 320 AR F. Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the Task Near the antenna to be installed H. To Prepare the Surface SUBTASK 110-002-A NOTE: Clean an area larger than that to which you will apply the sealant. (1) Remove the old sealant with a wood/plastic scraper. (2) Remove all loose sealant from the work area with a vacuum cleaner. (3) Use the cloth soaked in the MEK and clean the surface. Use a brush to clean around the bolts and rivets. (4) Make the surface dry with a clean cloth which does not release lints before the MEK becomes dry. CAUTION: DO NOT TOUCH THE CLEANED SURFACE WITH A BARE HAND OR THE NEW SEALANT WILL NOT BOND SATISFACTORILY. USE GLOVES IF IT IS NECESSARY TO TOUCH THE SURFACE. (5) Examine the area for corrosion and repair/replace as necessary. I. To Prepare the Sealant SUBTASK 910-002-A WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE CONSUMABLE MATERIAL(S). OBEY THE OPERATOR'S AND MANUFACTURER'S HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. (1) Make sure that the permitted life of the sealing compound or accelerator is not expired. NOTE: Do not use a base compound or accelerator that is dried out, flaky, or lumpy. (2) Weigh the correct ratio of the base compound to the accelerator (Table 201). Use only the quantity to be applied. Table 201 - BASE COMPOUND/ACCELERATOR RATIO Sealant PN Base: Accelerator Ratio (in weight) P/S 870 B-2 100:17 EMB-145  - AMM 1285 910-801-A/200 20-11-01 Page 3 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL Table 201 - BASE COMPOUND/ACCELERATOR RATIO (Continued) P/S 870 C-12 100:17 PR 1440 B2 10:1 (3) Mix the Accelerator and Base Compound in their containers until an equal consistency is got. (4) Slowly put the accelerator into the base compound and mix for approximately 4 to 5 minutes (P/S 870 B-2/C-12) or 7 to 10 minutes (PR 1440 B2). To make sure that the mixture is equal, remove the compound not mixed which bonds to the bottom and include all the compound in the mixture. Make sure that: – No compound not mixed stays on the spatula. – No air goes into the mixture. (5) Clean the mixing equipment with MEK and a cloth or brush. J. To Apply the Sealant SUBTASK 390-002-A WARNING: APPLY THE SEALANT IN OPEN AREAS AND DO NOT BREATHE ITS GASES. THE COMPOUNDS USED ARE POISONOUS AND FLAMMABLE. WEAR THE APPLICABLE GLOVES AND RESPIRATORS NOT TO PERMIT THESE MIXTURES TO TOUCH YOUR SKIN FOR LONG TIME. IF THE WORK IS TO BE DONE INDOORS, HAVE SUFFICIENT AIR AVAILABLE. (1) Apply the masking tape to the surface adjacent to the work area. (2) Hold the sealant gun almost vertically to the surface. This will force the extruded sealant into the joint (antenna - surface). For the application time, refer to Table 202. (3) Apply pressure to the sealant-gun handle and move the sealant-gun along the surface to be sealed. (4) Use a spatula to make the newly-applied sealant stay in the applicable shape and smooth. Use wet sanding to make the cured sealant get the correct shape and a smooth finish. Use the correct abrasive or applicable sharp-cutting tool. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the unwanted sealant with a cloth which does not release lints and MEK. (2) Remove and discard the masking tape. (3) Put an identifier near the sealed antenna with: • Date and Hour of the sealing. • Sealant curing time (Table 202). (4) Clean the tools with MEK.
