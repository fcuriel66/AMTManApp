			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 20-10-10-910-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. V-BAND CLAMPS - INSTALLATION A. General (1) This task gives the procedure to install V-band clamps on the aircraft. B. Zones and Accesses Not Applicable C. Tools and Equipment ITEM DESCRIPTION PURPOSE QTY Commercially Torque wrench To measure the torque  available Commercially Nonmetallic mallet To tap the V-band clamp  available D. Auxiliary Items Not Applicable E. Consumable Materials SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION QTY (BRAND) MIL-L-19538 Acrylic Nitrocellulose Gloss Lacquer AR F. Expandable Parts Not Applicable G. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Near the V-band clamp that you will install H. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that you use the specified V-band clamp part number. NOTE: Even though the fit can be good, the operating conditions require the correct V-band clamp installation. (2) Check if the V-band clamp is not damaged. If necessary, replace-it. (3) Check if the flanges that you will attach are not damaged. If necessary, replace the ducts. (4) Check if the flanges agree with the seal that you will use.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE DUCTS THAT YOU WILL ATTACH ARE ALIGNED WITH EACH OTHER. YOU CANNOT USE V-BAND CLAMPS TO PULL FLANGES INTO ALIGNMENT. (5) To eliminate misalignment, loosen all adjacent tubing supports. I. Installation of V-band Clamps SUBTASK 910-002-A (1) Slip the V-band clamp over the flanged tube end. (2) Install the seal, if applicable, and align the flanges. (3) Place the V-band clamp on the aligned flanges. (4) Tighten the nut to approximately 70% of the specified torque in the manual. NOTE: On two-latch assemblies, torque both latches equally. (5) Make sure that the V-band clamp engages equally over the flanges. (6) Make sure that the alignment of the flanges is correct. (7) Lightly tap the V-band clamp around its circumference with a nonmetallic mallet to distribute band tension. NOTE: In case of restrict access, tap the V-band clamp where possible. (8) As torque increases toward 100% of the specified value, lightly tap again around the outer periphery as necessary to prevent unequal loading. CAUTION: DO NOT OVERTORQUE THE V-BAND CLAMP TO STOP JOINT LEAKAGE. IF YOU FIND A LEAK, DO A CHECK FOR INCORRECT ASSEMBLY, INCORRECT TORQUE OR DAMAGE TO FLANGES OR SEAL. (9) After you torque the V-band clamp to 100% of specified torque, retap around the band and retorque once more to the specified value. (10) Mark the nut and bolt assembly with acrylic gloss lacquer for inspection purposes. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Adjust and tighten tubing supports as required. (2) Do a leakage test as specified in the procedure for installation of each duct. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 910-801-A/200 20-10-10 Page 3 of 3 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
