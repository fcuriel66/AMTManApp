			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 20-10-04-300-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. HYDRAULIC HOSE - REPAIR A. General (1) This procedure gives the instructions to repair tubes. (2) Do a check on the wear spots of the Aeroquip hose. (a) A repair sleeve is not necessary if the silicone cover was gouged, nicked, abraded, or cut to a depth of 0.76 mm (0.030 in) or less. (b) Wear spots where the wire braid is exposed must be examined for wire damage. NOTE: Hose with damaged reinforcement wire must be replaced. (3) Do a check on the wear spots of the Parker hose. (a) Conditions in which it is necessary to replace the hose: 1. Firesleeve braid is fluid wetted. 2. Tear or void (air bubble) is deeper than 0.03 in by 0.25 in x 0.25 in. 3. Wear spots have the wire braid exposed. 4. Length of a lateral cut is more than 3 in. 5. Length of a cut perpendicular to the length of the hose is more than a quarter of the circumference. 6. Gouges in the damaged area are more than 1 in by 1 in and 0.03 deep. B.

Expandable Parts Not Applicable H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task On damaged hose I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open the ELEC PUMP 1 and (or) ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker(s) and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to it (them). (3) Make sure that the pressure in the related system is fully released. (4) When you do the removal procedure near the landing gear, make sure that the landing-gear safety pins are installed ( AMM TASK 32-00-01-910-801-A/200). CAUTION: DO NOT LET LINES OR FITTINGS STAY WITHOUT CAPS. DIRT CAN CAUSE SYSTEM CONTAMINATION, DAMAGE TO COMPONENTS, AND LEAKAGE. (5) Install protection caps to the system fittings. (6) With a cloth and cleaning solvent (Rhodiasolve E-23), clean the leaked fluid. J. Repair of Hydraulic Hose SUBTASK 360-002-A (1) To repair the Aeroquip integral silicone-covered hose, do as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 20-10-04 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: A repair sleeve is not necessary if the silicone cover was gouged, nicked, abraded, or cut to a depth of 0.76 mm (0.030 in) or less. (a) Remove the hose to be repaired as necessary. (b) Do the repair (Figure 801). (c) Install the hose as necessary. (2) To repair the Parker integral-silicone hose, do as follows: (a) Repair to a cut cover: 1 Clean the area of the cut with acetone to remove dirt, oil, and foreign matter. 2 Use a cloth to remove the acetone. 3 Fill the cut with RTV 106 until the RTV is flush with the silicone-hose outer diameter. 4 Let the RTV cure for minimum of 24 hours. 5 Bend the assembly and do a check for correct bonding between the RTV and the silicone hose cover. If the sealant comes loose from the silicone cover, remove the sealant and do the repair again. (b) Repair of gouges: 1 Clean the area of the cut with acetone to remove dirt, oil, and foreign matter. 2 Use a cloth to remove the acetone. 3 Cover with RTV 106 all the area from which the silicone cover was torn or gouged away. NOTE: The RTV layer must be flush with or slightly higher than the outer surface of the undamaged silicone cover. 4 Let the RTV cure for a minimum of 24 hours. 5 Bend the assembly and do a check for correct bonding between the RTV and the silicone hose cover. If the sealant comes loose from the silicone cover, remove the sealant and do the repair again. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Do a check on the fluid level in the hydraulic system reservoir ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-801-A/300). If necessary, fill it ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-802-A/300). (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the ELEC PUMP 1 and (or) ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breaker(s) and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it (them).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Pressurize the related system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200) and do a check for leaks at the hydraulic line which you worked on. NOTE: Most of the hydraulic lines can be pressurized on ground by pressurizing the related hydraulic system (1 or 2). Guidance in the AMM Part I and/or SSM can be used for more determination on the pressurization requirements for the related line. All the safety and preparation procedures must be followed as given in the AMM before you apply the pressurization procedures. (4) If you find leaks, repair them and do a check on the fluid level in the hydraulic system again. (5) Do the bleed of air from the related hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-803- A/200). (6) Remove all tools, materials, and equipment from the work area. (7) Make sure the area is clean. (8) Close the applicable access doors/panels.
