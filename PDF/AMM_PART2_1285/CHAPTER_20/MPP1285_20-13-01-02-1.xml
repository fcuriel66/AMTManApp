			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 20-13-01-910-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  AIRCRAFT WITHOUT CURSOR CONTROL DEVICE (CCD) 2. DISPLAY UNIT - DEGAUSSING A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to degauss the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Display Units (DU). (2) The displays can be magnetized after a lightning strike onto the aircraft. If it occurs, their colors can change. (3) Degaussing can be done in all DU positions but the measurement procedure can only be done in the MFDs positions. Thus, it is recommended that you move the DU to one of these positions before you start. (4) After the display is degaussed, it is necessary to do the measurement procedure to make sure that the alignment of the three electron guns in the CRT of the DU is correct. (5) Use the Klein gauge with the vertical and horizontal white lines that you can see in the MFD and PFD displays. (6) The horizontal and vertical white lines will be shown in the upper left and upper right corners of the PFD display. The horizontal and vertical white lines will be shown in the lower left and lower right corners of the MFD display when the TCAS mode is set. B.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the DU to be degaussed is installed in the MFD positions. Refer to AMM TASK 34-22-01-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 34-22-01-400-801-A/400. (2) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Make sure that these systems are operational and on: – Integrated Computer System (AMM SDS 31-42-00/1). – EFIS (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1). – EICAS (AMM SDS 31-41-00/1). J. Degaussing (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 910-002-A WARNING: OBEY THE DEGAUSSING COIL OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS TO PREVENT OVERHEATING, FAILURE OF THE COIL, DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT, AND/OR THE RISK OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK. CAUTION: KEEP THE DEGAUSSING COIL AWAY FROM MAGNETIC MEDIA. A DEGAUSSING COIL WILL ERASE MAGNETIC MEDIA. CAUTION: THE DEGAUSSING COIL MUST NOT BE OPERATED FOR MORE THAN ONE MINUTE CONTINUOUSLY. AFTER ONE MINUTE OF OPERATION, STOP FOR THIRTY MINUTES TO LET THE COIL COOL. (1) Operate the degaussing coil. (2) Hold the degaussing coil at approximately three feet (one meter) from the DU, with the plane of the coil parallel to the front of the display.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Push and hold the switch on the coil while you move the coil in a circular motion. Slowly move the coil to the DU until the circular movement is 2 inches (50 mm) from the DU. (4) After a few seconds of circular movements near the DU, slowly move the coil back out to approximately three feet (one meter) while you continue the circular motion of the coil and release the switch. (5) Do the alignment measurement (SUBTASK 910-003-A) and make sure that all measurements is less than 0.4 mm. K. Alignment Measurement (Figure 201)  (Figure 202)  SUBTASK 910-003-A (1) Operate the Klein Gauge as follows (Figure 202): NOTE: Use white lines only for measurements. (a) Put the gauge against the screen in an area where convergence is to be measured. The orientation of the gauge shown is for measurement of convergence error in the "Y" direction. To measure the "X" direction, the gauge is turned 90 degrees. Refer to DET. A. (b) If the horizontal lines of the grid pattern are not converged, they will come into view as three separate red, green, and blue lines. Turn the knob to each side of the gauge until the brightness centers of the three images align. Refer to DET. B. (c) The image is now optically converged, and the amount of convergence error between blue/green and red/green can be read from the scales. Refer to DET. C. (d) If the outer lines are high and low from the center line as shown in DET. B, then the absolute value of the measurements must be added and the sum must be no larger than 0.4 mm. (e) If the two outer lines are high or the two of them are low from center then the larger of the two measurements must be less than or equal to 0.4mm from center. Ignore the smaller measurement. (2) Push the TCAS bezel button to start the TCAS display. (3) Put the Klein gauge on the MFD display. (4) Make Klein Gauge measurements, as written in item (1), of white line locations 1 through 5 as shown in Figure 201. (5) Turn the MFD rotary switch, on the left reversionary panel, to the PFD position. (a) The MFD is configured to operate as a PFD. (6) Make Klein Gauge measurements of white line locations 6 through 9 as shown in Figure 201. (7) If one of the nine measurements is more than 0.4mm then do the degaussing procedure again (SUBTASK 910-002-A). If you cannot get 0.4mm minimum then send the DU back to the Honeywell, Inc. service center for repair.

Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) If you change any display unit to the MFD position, exchange the display unit back to its original position. Refer to AMM TASK 34-22-01-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 34-22-01-400-801-A/400. (2) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
