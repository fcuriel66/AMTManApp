			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TUBING - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. Always obey these procedures during the removal/installation of tubes: (1) System identification. (2) Tubing assembly configuration. CAUTION: REFER TO THE MAINTENANCE MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS, AND FULLY RELEASE PRESSURE FROM THE APPLICABLE SYSTEM BEFORE YOU START THE REMOVAL OF THE TUBE. (3) Tubing material identification. B. For the tubing removal, obey the necessary precautions to prevent fluid spillage; if it occurs, immediately clean the spillage up (AMM TASK 12-22-00-600-801-A/300). WARNING: • FOR OXYGEN TUBING REMOVAL/INSTALLATION, REFER TO AMM TASK 35-10-00-910-801-A/200 AND AMM TASK 35-10-00-910-803-A/200. • FOR FUEL TUBING REMOVAL/INSTALLATION, REFER TO AMM TASK 28-00-01-000-801-A/400 AND AMM TASK 28-00-01-400-801-A/400. C. Serviceable nuts and fitting can be used again after the removal of tubing. D. For the tubing installation, correctly align the fittings and tubing to permit the nuts to be turned down by hand before the wrench tightening. Do not use fitting nuts to pull tubing and/or fittings into alignment. E. Use the applicable torque wrench for the correct torque application. If it is necessary to use extensions, the torque wrench must be adjusted to make an allowance for the torque value increase or decrease. Refer to the torque connection method in (AMM MPP 20-10-01/200). F. Torque values, when given in the Maintenance Manual tasks, have priority over the torque given in this section. G. Refer to AMM MPP 06-41-01/100, AMM MPP 06-41-02/100, AMM MPP 06-42-00/100, AMM MPP 06-43-00/100, and AMM MPP 06-44-00/100 for access to the tubes. H. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task In the repair area I. Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-002-A CAUTION:DO NOT TRY TO MAKE A TEFLON HOSE THAT WAS IN SERVICE STRAIGHT AGAIN. TEFLON HOSES CAN GET PERMANENT SETS WHEN EXPOSED TO HIGH PRESSURE OR TEMPERATURE. AN EXCESSIVE BENDING OR TWISTING CAN CAUSE KINKING OR WEAKENING OF THE TUBING WALL. (1) Do a check of the tubing for abrasion, kinking, protection, wear, dents, scores, bent, and notches. (2) Examine tubing ends, sleeves, and sealing areas of fittings for cleanliness, defects, and contamination that can decrease sealing effectiveness. CAUTION: DO NOT PERMIT THE PENETRATION OF LUBRICANTS INTO TUBES OR FITTINGS. (3) Carefully apply a thin coat of lubricant on the threads of the locking nut and fittings. Refer to item F and Figure 401. (4) Put the tubing in the aircraft. Do not apply the final torque to clamps, tubing clamp blocks, and bonding wires, if applicable, to pull the tubing into alignment with the fitting. NOTE: If the tubing is flexible, carefully prevent kinks as a result of sharp bends or twisting. (5) Align the tubes and fittings. Let the tube end stay against the fitting. CAUTION: TOO MUCH TIGHTENING CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THREADS OR MATING PARTS. BEFORE YOU APPLY THE TORQUE, HOLD THE UNION OR FITTING WITH THE CORRECT WRENCH. (6) Hold the tube end against and aligned with the fitting. Turn the nut by hand until it touches the sleeve or flange. CAUTION: • DO NOT USE A TIGHTENING NUT TO PULL THE TUBING INTO ALIGNMENT. • DO NOT USE A FLEXIBLE-TUBING-END ADAPTER FOR TORQUE APPLICATION. • MAKE SURE THAT THE FLEXIBLE TUBE IS NOT TWISTED BEFORE AND AFTER TORQUE APPLICATION. • FOR FLEXIBLE HOSES WITH REUSABLE FITTINGS OF THE TYPE SHOWN IN FIGURE 402, APPLY TORQUE TO THE POINTS SHOWN. (7) Hold the union or fitting with the correct wrench and tighten the assembly. Refer to Tables 401, 402, 403, or 404, as applicable, and torque the tightening nut or fitting.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (8) If it is not possible to use a torque wrench to torque nuts of flareless sleeve tubing, the torque can be applied manually. After that, add a torque of 1/6 to 1/3 (one or two hex flats) turn. (9) If applicable, tighten all tubing clamps, tubing clamp blocks, and bonding wires. (10) Prepare the surface to install the bonding jumpers as follows: (a) Clean the areas to be bonded with a clean cloth soaked with MEK solvent. (b) Rub the areas with a clean dry cloth before the solvent evaporation. (11) Install the bonding jumpers on the hydraulic tubing immediately after the faying surface is cleaned. CAUTION: • BONDING OHMIC RESISTANCE IS A VERY IMPORTANT ITEM WHEN THERE IS A LIGHTNING STRIKE. • MAKE SURE THAT THE CLEARANCE BETWEEN INSTALLED TUBING AND OTHER COMPONENTS (STRUCTURES, WIRING, AND ADJACENT TUBING) IS CORRECT. IT IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT TUBING DAMAGE IN ALL OPERATION CONDITIONS. (12) Do the bonding test as follows: (a) Connect the milliohmmeter alligator clip to the nearest ground point given in the table.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • APU shunt attachment bracket (in the tail-cone compartment). It is necessary to remove the shunt protection cover to get access to the shunt. (b) With the milliohmmeter alligator clip connected to the nearest applicable ground point, put the probe on the bonded hydraulic tube to measure the related resistance. (c) The maximum resistance value must be less than 150 milliohms. If the resistance value is greater, remove the bonding jumpers, do steps 9 and 10, then install them and test again. (13) Do the corrosion protection of the bonded area. Refer to AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-802-A/200. J. Follow on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Make sure the tube is not be bent. (2) Remove all tools, materials, and equipment from the work area. (3) Make sure the area is clean. (4) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the related system circuit breaker, and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (5) Pressurize the related system and do a check for leaks. NOTE: Most of the hydraulic lines can be pressurized on ground by pressurizing the related hydraulic system (1 or 2). Guidance in the AMM Part I and/or SSM can be used for more determination on the pressurization requirements for the related line. All the safety and preparation procedures must be followed as given in the AMM before you apply the pressurization procedures. (6) Do the bleed of the air from the related hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-803-A/200.
