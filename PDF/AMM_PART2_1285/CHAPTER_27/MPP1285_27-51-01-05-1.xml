			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Do not do other tasks on the flap system. (3) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (4) Set the flaps to the 45-degree position. (5) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (6) De-energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (7) Open the lower shroud of the outboard flap (AMM MPP 06-30-00/100). J. Functionally Check Flap Transmission Brake Holding Capability (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Get access to the right Flap Transmission Brake (FTB). (2) Disconnect Flap Flexible Shaft (FFS) section 4. This shaft extends from the actuator installed at the root of the outboard flap to the Flap Transmission Brake. Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-07-000-801-A/400. (3) Disconnect Flap Flexible Shaft (FFS) section 5. This shaft extends from the Flap Transmission Brake to the actuator installed at the tip of the flap outboard panel. Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-08-000-801-A/400. (4) Install the FTB Test Fixture on the Flap Transmission Brake. Refer to Figure 501. (5) Use the FTB Test Fixture (GSE 071 or click-type torque wrench, as recommended) to apply a torque of 7 N.m (62 lbf.in), clockwise, to the FTB (CW). Smoothly and continuously increase the torque to avoid misinterpretations of the torque value. Then apply a torque of 7 N.m (62 lbf.in) to the FTB counterclockwise (CCW). Smoothly and continuously increase the torque. NOTE: • It is recommended that you use a click-type torque wrench to avoid false indications or occurrences and minimize human factor during the functional check. • When you start to apply the torque, a small angular movement occurs because of the FTB backlash. Other angular movements are not allowed. (6) Remove the FTB Test Fixture or click-type torque wrench. (7) Connect the FFS section 4 and lockwire it. Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-07-400-801-A/ 400.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (8) Connect the FFS section 5 and lockwire it. Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-08-400-801-A/ 400. NOTE: • You can install the ends of the FFS in two directions. • But we recommend that you install the type-A end of FFS section 5 to the flap actuator, and the type-B end of FFS section 5 to the FTB. Thus, grease will not get into the FTB. • Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-08-400-801-A/400. (9) Do steps 1 thru 5 again for the left Flap Transmission Brake. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the lower shroud of the outboard flap (AMM MPP 06-30-00/100). (2) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them. (4) Do the operational check of the Flap Control System ( AMM TASK 27-51-00-700-801- A/500). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-51-01 Page 4 of 5 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
