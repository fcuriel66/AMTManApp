			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Control Yoke Adjustment and Check (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-B WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSON OR EQUIPMENT IN THE AILERON TRAVEL AREA. NOTE: Do the check below for the pilot and copilot control yoke. (1) Install the rig pin to the control yoke in the neutral position (Figure 502). (2) Install GSE 070 on the pilot control yoke; use a paper masking tape. (3) Set the dial protactor to zero. (4) Remove the rig pin from the control yoke. (5) Deflect the control yoke clockwise and anti-clockwise until the primary backstop is reached and keep the control yoke in this movement until the secondary backstops are reached. (6) Do a check of the control yoke for deflection angle with the aid of the protactor. Table 501 - CONTROL YOKE DEFLECTION CONTROL YOKE Clockwise deflection Anti-clockwise deflection 47 ÃÂ± 1ÃÂ° 47 ÃÂ± 1ÃÂ° (7) If necessary, adjust the secondary backstop: (a) Cut and remove the tiedown straps (3) (4 positions) to release the electrical harness from the control column. (b) Remove the cover (2). For this, remove the screws (1) (3 positions ) and (4). (c) Cut and remove the secondary backstop lockwires (6). (d) Deflect the control yoke clockwise and anti clockwise until the primary backstop is reached and keep the control yoke in this movement until the secondary backstops is reached. Keep the control yoke in this position and adjust the secondary backstop height (5). Refer to the deflection angle on the protactor. (e) Deflect the control yoke to the neutral position. (f) Safety the secondary backstop. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Set the control yoke to the neutral position. (2) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200.
