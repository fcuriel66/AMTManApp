Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Fuselage 1 Helps the other technician Fuselage I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-013-C (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Do not do other tasks on the rudder system. (3) Remove cockpit underfloor access hatch 123BL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (4) Remove the cover of the FWD Cargo Compartment Partition (AMM TASK 25-27-02-000-801-A/400). (5) Remove floor panel 261BF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (6) Open access door 312AR (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100). J. Functionally Check Tension of Rudder Control Cables (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 720-013-C (1) Measure the temperature in the fuselage. NOTE: • You must adjust the rudder control cables with the aircraft parked for a minimum of one hour in the hangar. • To measure the temperature, you must put the thermometer near the control cable circuit. Let the thermometer stay in position for a minimum of 5 minutes, until the temperature becomes stable. (2) Use the graph of Figure 502 to get the load value related to the temperature. NOTE: The tolerance for the rudder control cable tension is ÃÂ± 5 lbf (ÃÂ± 2.3 kgf). CAUTION: • TURN THE BARREL OF THE TURNBUCKLE TO APPLY TENSION TO THE CONTROL CABLE. DO NOT TURN THE CONTROL CABLE TO TENSION IT. • WHEN YOU APPLY TENSION TO THE RUDDER CONTROL CABLES, YOU MUST DO A VISUAL CHECK ON THE UNION OF THE RUDDER CONTROL CABLES AND RUDDER AUTOPILOT CONTROL CABLES FOR GENERAL CONDITION AND INTEGRITY.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Settling-down check (Immediately after the replacement of an old cable with a new one only). NOTE: Do step 4 for other control cable circuit (s) where you did not replace the control cable (s). (a) Install the rig pins to the forward torque tube and rear torque tube. See Figure 501. (b) With the aid of GSE 380 (Figure 504) and only in the control cable circuit (s) where you replaced the control cable (s), do as follows: 1 Apply sufficient tension to only stretch out the cables and then make sure that the insertion points of the Rudder Servo into the primary rudder control cable are correctly positioned (refer to AMM TASK 27-21-01-400-802-A/ 400). 2 Apply a load to the rudder control cable circuit 50% higher than the load related to the measured temperature. WARNING: DO NOT OPERATE THE RUDDER SYSTEM WITH THE RIG PINS INSTALLED TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE RIGGING HOLES/PINS. (c) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH RUDDER−CONTROL STAINLESS−STEEL CABLES) Remove the rig pins and do ten (10) full rudder command cycles (fully left - neutral - fully right - neutral - for each cycle). NOTE: You can operate the rudder system in two modes: mechanical reversion or hydraulic power. Use the mode which is easier for you. WARNING: DO NOT OPERATE THE RUDDER SYSTEM WITH THE RIG PINS INSTALLED TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE RIGGING HOLES/PINS. (d) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH RUDDER−CONTROL CARBON−STEEL CABLES) Remove the rig pins and do twenty (20) full rudder command cycles (fully left - neutral - fully right - neutral - for each cycle). NOTE: You must operate the rudder system in the mechanical reversion mode. (e) Install the rig pins to the forward torque tube and rear torque tube. See Figure 501. (f) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH RUDDER−CONTROL STAINLESS−STEEL CABLES) With the aid of GSE 380 (Figure 504) adjust the load of the rudder control cables installed in the fuselage to the value related to the measured temperature in step 1. (g) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH RUDDER−CONTROL CARBON−STEEL CABLES) Measure the tension of the rudder control cables in the fuselage: NOTE: You must measure the cable tension away from the pulleys, turnbuckles, and cable passages. 1 If you get the tension value 50% higher than the load related to the measured temperature given in the graph of Figure 502, keep the system under tension for a minimum of 24 hours.
