			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Elevator I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Do not do other tasks on the elevator and horizontal stabilizer system. (3) Make sure that there are no objects or persons in the elevator and horizontal stabilizer travel area. (4) Open door 272DR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (5) Make sure that steps (1), (2), (3), and (4) of Installation of Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator - Installation (item 3.I. of the AMM TASK 27-40-02-400-801-A/400) are done. (6) On the overhead Circuit Breaker Panel, make sure that the circuit PITCH TRIM 1 and PITCH TRIM 2 circuit breakers are open. • PITCH TRIM 1 (Location Tip: DC BUS 1/FLIGHT CONTROLS/PITCH TRIM 1). • PITCH TRIM 2 (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/PITCH TRIM 2). (7) Do these procedures to connect GSE 063 to the HSCU (Figure 501). (a) Disconnect the connectors P1082 and P1083 from the HSCU and connect them to the electrical connectors J1082 and J1083 of the GSE 063, respectively. (b) Connect electrical connectors P4 and P5 of GSE 063 to the J4 and J5 electrical connectors of HSCU, respectively. (8) On the overhead Circuit Breaker Panel, close the PITCH TRIM 1 and PITCH TRIM 2 circuit breakers. • PITCH TRIM 1 (Location Tip: DC BUS 1/FLIGHT CONTROLS/PITCH TRIM 1). • PITCH TRIM 2 (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/PITCH TRIM 2). (9) Push the MAIN CUTOUT switch and BACK-UP CUTOUT switch, on the trim panel (switch lights OFF). J. Adjustment of the Electrical Zero Position and the Left Attachment of the Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 720-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR OBJECTS IN THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER TRAVEL AREA. (1) Set the Electrical Zero Position of the Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator as follows: (a) Set the multimeter to read the voltage between WIPER and EXC - of the MAIN channel (HSA 1) on the Horizontal Stabilizer break-out box.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Through the RET and EXT switches of the MAIN channel of the Horizontal Stabilizer break-out box, control the horizontal stabilizer to the UP and DOWN positions, until the multimeter reads 6.58 V. When this value is got, the Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator is at the electrical zero position and the EICAS indicates zero position on PITCH. (c) Set the multimeter to read the voltage between WIPER and EXC - of the BACK UP channel (HSA 2). The value must be between 6.51 V and 6.65 V. (2) Adjustment of the Left Attachment of the Horizontal Stabilizer Actuator. (a) Set the multimeter to read the voltage between MOT CURR and EXC - of the MAIN channel (HSA 1) on the Horizontal Stabilizer break-out box. (b) Control the Horizontal Stabilizer to the UP and DOWN positions through the RET and EXT switches of the Main Channel of the Horizontal Stabilizer break-out box. When set to UP or DOWN position, the actuator moves and the multimeter shows values in proportion to the movement of the actuator. Read and record, for either direction, the maximum steady-state (not peak) value shown on the multimeter. If the result is more than 2.06 Volts, adjust the Left Attachment. 1 Fine adjustment of the length of Left Attachment (left HSA rod end) (Figure 503): a Cut and remove the lockwire (8). b Release the small jam nut (2). c Move the serrated locking washers (7) away from the adjusting nut (3) until they disengage. d Turn the adjusting nut (3) to adjust the length of HSA rod end as necessary to permit the bolt installation without interference. NOTE: One turn (360 degrees) of the adjusting nut (3) changes the rod end (1) length in approximately 1.41 mm (0.055 in). e Engage the serrated locking washers (7) to the adjusting nut (3). f Tighten the small jam nut (2) to a torque value of 74.6 to 81.3 N.m (660 to 720 lb.in). g Safety-wire the rod end (1) with the lockwire (8) to prevent the small jam nut (3) from loosening. 2 If you cannot get rig condition after the fine adjustment do the combined fine and coarse adjustment of the length of left attachment. 3 Combined fine and coarse adjustment of the length of Left Attachment (left HSA rod end) (Figure 503): a Cut and remove the lockwire (8). b Release the small jam nut (2).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL c Move the serrated locking washers (7) away from the adjusting nut (3) until they disengage. d Turn all the tabs of the locking tab washer (6) until they become straight. CAUTION:THE LARGE JAM NUT (4) HAS A LEFT-HAND THREAD. MAKE SURE THAT IT IS TURNED IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION, SPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOSEN IT. CAUTION: THE ROTATION MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE RAM TUBE AND THE ACTUATOR HOUSING CAN BREAK THE TORQUE INSIDE WITH THE ACME SCREW. MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO ROTATION BETWEEN THEM. e While you hold the ram tube wrench flats (5), loosen the large jam nut (4) away from the locking tab washer (6). f Turn the adjusting nut (3) to adjust the length of HSA rod end as necessary to permit the bolt installation without interference. NOTE: One turn (360 degrees) of the adjusting nut (3) changes the rod end (1) length in approximately 1.41 mm (0.055 in). g Tighten the large jam nut (4) to a torque value of 122.0 to 135.6 N.m (1080 to 1200 lb.in). h Engage the serrated locking washers (7) to the adjusting nut (3). i Tighten the small jam nut (2) to a torque value of 74.6 to 81.3 N.m (660 to 720 lb.in). j Safety-wire the rod end (1) with the lockwire (8) to prevent the small jam nut (3) from loosening. (c) Set the multimeter to read the voltage between MOT CURR and EXC - of the BACK UP channel (HSA 2) on the Horizontal Stabilizer break-out box. Do as in step (b) for the BACK UP channel. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the overhead Circuit Breaker Panel, make sure that the circuit PITCH TRIM 1 and PITCH TRIM 2 circuit breakers are open. • PITCH TRIM 1 (Location Tip: DC BUS 1/FLIGHT CONTROLS/PITCH TRIM 1). • PITCH TRIM 2 (Location Tip: ESSENTIAL DC BUS 2/PITCH TRIM 2). (2) Do these procedures to disconnect GSE 063 from the HSCU: (a) Disconnect the J1082 and J1083 electrical connectors of GSE 063 from the aircraft electrical connectors P1082 and P1083. (b) Disconnect electrical connectors P4 and P5 of GSE 063 from the J4 and J5 electrical connectors of the HSCU.
