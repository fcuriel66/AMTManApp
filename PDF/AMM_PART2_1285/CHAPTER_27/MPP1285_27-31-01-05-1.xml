			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Do this step to adjust the elevator control cables for aircraft POST-MOD S.B. 145-27-0064. (a) Measure the temperature in the fuselage. Write the value in table 501. NOTE: • You must adjust the elevator control cables with the aircraft parked for a minimum of one hour in the hangar. • To measure the temperature, you must put the thermometer near the control cable circuit. Leave the thermometer in place for a minimum of 5 minutes, until the temperature becomes stable. Table 501 - FUSELAGE TEMPERATURE AND LIMITS OF THE TENSION REGULATOR SCALE Limit of the scale Fuselage Temperature ÃÂ°C (ÃÂ°F) minimum maximum     (b) Do ten (10) full elevator command cycles (fully forward - neutral - fully backward - neutral). (c) Install rig pins at the elevator torque tube. See Figure 501. (d) Do a check of the position of the scale of the tension regulator and for misalignment of the elevator surface. 1 Do a check of the position of the scale of the left tension regulators. See Figure 504. • This position must agree with the graph of Figure 502. NOTE: Read one scale only on the left tension regulator. Use the easier-to- read scale. 2 Do this procedure for the left elevator surface to make sure that its misalignment is of 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees. a Install the rig pin at the rear sector. See Figure 501. b Install the digital protractor in the left elevator. Use double-face adhesive tape. See Figure 503. c Set the digital protractor to zero. d Remove the rig pin from the rear sector. e Make sure that you get the 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5-degree indication in the digital protractor. 3 Do steps (i) thru (q) to adjust the elevator control cables if one or two of the conditions listed below occurs: • If the position of the left tension regulator does not agree with the graph of Figure 502.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • If the misalignment is not of 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees. (e) Do step (d) again for the right elevator surface to do a check of the position of the scale of the right tension regulator and for misalignment of the right elevator surface. (f) With the rig pin removed from the rear sector, do a check of the tension of the four control cables of the elevator control cable circuits. • The tension must be of 40.0 lbf to 62.5 lbf (19.3 kgf to 27.2 kgf). • The internal cables of the two circuits must be tensioned to 0 to 5 lbf (2.3 kgf) more than the external cables of the two circuits. (g) This task is completed if: • The position of the scale of the both tension regulators agree with the graph of Figure 502. • The misalignment of the both elevator surfaces is of 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees as in step (d). • The tension of the four control cables is 40.0 lbf to 62.5 lbf (19.3 kgf to 27.2 kgf). (h) Do step (i) thru (q) to adjust the elevator control cables if: • The position of the scale of one tension regulator does not agree with the graph of Figure 502. Adjust the related control cable circuit. • The position of the scale of the two tension regulators do not agree with the graph of Figure 502. Adjust the two control cable circuits. • The misalignment of one elevator is not of 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees as in step (d). Adjust the related control cable circuit. • The misalignment of the two elevators is not of 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees as in step (d). Adjust the two control cable circuits. (i) Remove and discard the locking clips from the turnbuckles of the elevator control cables. See Figure 505. (j) Install the rig pins at the rear sectors. (k) Install the digital protractor in the elevator. Use double-face adhesive tape. See Figure 503. (l) Set the digital protractor to zero. (m) Remove the rig pin from the rear sector. (n) With the aid of GSE 380 (Figure 509), adjust the elevator control cables to get these two conditions: • You must get the value on the scale of the tension regulator read in step (d).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • You must return the elevator surface to the aligned position (0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees indication on the digital protractor). NOTE: • If you retract the turnbuckle of the inboard cable and extend the turnbuckle of the outboard one, you move the elevator trailing edge surface upward, and vice versa. See Figure 505. • If you equally retract the turnbuckle of two cables of the same circuit, you increase the value on the scale of the Cable Tension Regulator without movement of the elevator surface, and vice versa. (o) Install new locking clips to the turnbuckles of the elevator control cables. See Figure 505. (p) While you do step (n), the adjustment of the elevator control cables may fail due to locking of the cable tension regulator. Do this procedure to get the two conditions of step (n), if you think that the cable tension regulator is locked: 1 Remove the digital protractor from the elevator surface. 2 Shake the elevator surface. 3 Install the rig pin at the rear sector. 4 Install the digital protractor in the same previous position. 5 Set the digital protractor to zero. 6 Remove the rig pin from the rear sector. 7 Do steps (n) and (o) to adjust the elevator control cables. (q) With the rig pin removed from the rear sector, do a check of the tension of the four control cables. • The tension must be of 40.0 lbf to 62.5 lbf (19.3 kgf to 27.2 kgf). • The internal cables of the two circuits must be tensioned to 0 to 5 lbf (2.3 kgf) more than the external cables of the two circuits. (2) Do this step to adjust the elevator control cables for aircraft PRE-MOD S.B. 145-27-0064. (a) Measure the temperature in the fuselage. NOTE: • You must adjust the elevator control cables with the aircraft parked for a minimum of one hour in the hangar. • To measure the temperature, you must put the thermometer near the control cable circuit. Let the thermometer stay in position for a minimum of 5 minutes, until the temperature becomes stable. (b) Do ten (10) full elevator command cycles (fully forward - neutral - fully backward - neutral).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Install rig pin at the elevator torque tube and at the rear sector. Refer to Figure 501. (d) Measure the tension in the four control cables. Use the graph of Figure 506 to get the tension value related to the temperature. • The tolerance for the tension of the elevator control cables is ÃÂ± 5 lbf (ÃÂ± 2.3 kgf). • Use approximately the same value (maximum difference of 2 lbf or 1 kgf) for the four cables. (e) If necessary, do this procedure to adjust the tension of the cables to get these two conditions. 1 Remove and discard the locking clips from the turnbuckles of the elevator control cables. See Figure 505. 2 With the aid of GSE 380 (Figure 509), turn the barrel of the turnbuckle to apply tension to the control cable. Do not turn the control cable to tension it. 3 Install new locking clips to the turnbuckles of the elevator control cables. See Figure 505. (f) Do this procedure for the left elevator surface to make sure that its misalignment is of 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees. 1 Make sure that the rig pin of the rear sector is installed (Figure 501). 2 Install the digital protractor at the left elevator. Use double-face adhesive tape. Refer to Figure 503. 3 Set the digital protractor to zero. 4 Remove the rig pin from the rear sector. 5 Make sure that you get the 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5-degree indication on the digital protractor. (g) If necessary, with the aid of GSE 380 (Figure 509), adjust the elevator control cables to get the aligned position of the elevator (0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees in the digital protractor). NOTE: If you retract the turnbuckle of the inboard cable and extend the turnbuckle of the outboard one, you move the elevator trailing edge surface upward, and vice versa. See Figure 505. (h) Do steps (f) and (g) for the right elevator surface. (i) This task is completed if: • The misalignment of each elevator surface is of 0.0 ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees. • The four elevator control cables are correctly tensioned. Refer to step (d).
