Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: • MAKE SURE THAT THE RUDDER, HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, AND ELEVATOR CANNOT BE OPERATED ACCIDENTALLY. AN ACCIDENTAL OPERATION CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. • CA-1000 CORROSION-INHIBITING COMPOUND IS TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES, AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. USE PVC GLOVES AND EYE PROTECTION. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. OBEY THE MANUFACTURERS' HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. (1) Before the installation of the spring cartridge, refer to AMM TASK 27-71-03-700-801- A/500 for the functional test. (2) Install the sleeve (16) into the support (15) and use the retaining ring (13) to lock it. Refer to (Figure 401). CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THE SHIMS BETWEEN THE SUPPORT AND STRUCTURE ARE INSTALLED IN THE SAME POSITION AS THEY WERE BEFORE THE REMOVAL OF THE SUPPORT. THIS IS NECESSARY TO KEEP THE ALIGNMENT OF THE SPRING CARTRIDGE AS IT WAS BEFORE THE SUPPORT (15) REMOVAL. (3) Before the installation of the support (15), remove the old sealant and apply sealant PS870 C-12. Refer to (Figure 401). (4) Install the support (15) to the horizontal stabilizer structure with the bolts (17), washers (18) and nuts (19). Apply the correct torque. Refer to (Figure 401). (5) Install the spring cartridge (12) into the horizontal stabilizer torque box and push until it reaches the support (15). Refer to (Figure 401). (6) Apply corrosion-inhibiting compound as shown in (Figure 401). For this, use gloves and goggles.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (7) Use the bolt (9), washer (10), and nuts (11) to install the flanged support (14) in the horizontal stabilizer torque box. Refer to (Figure 401). NOTE: If necessary to permit a good alignment and free movement of the spring- cartridges (12), use shims to aid the installation of the flanged support (14) to the horizontal stabilizer torque box. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-03-700-802-A/ 500. (8) Apply a thin layer of sealant PS870 C-12 to the flanged support region that contacts the carbon box. Refer to Figure 402. (9) Install the spring cartridge (12) to the bellcrank arm (3) with the bolt (1), bushing (5), washer (6) nut (7) and cotter pin (8). Refer to (Figure 401). (10) Make sure that the bolts (1) that attach the spring cartridges to the bellcranks are tightly connected. Refer to (Figure 401). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Install the spring-cartridge position mechanism. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-14-400-801-A/400. (2) Install the electromechanical gust lock actuator. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-01-400-801-A/400. (3) Do the operational check of the electromechanical gust lock system. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-00-700-801-A/500. (4) Do the operational check of the electromechanical actuator. Refer to AMM TASK 27-71-01-700-801-A/500. If the check of the actuator is not OK, check the components of the electromechanical gust lock mechanism for excessive internal friction forces. Refer to FIM TASK 27-70-00-810-808-A. (5) Install rear fairings 321 of the horizontal stabilizer ( AMM TASK 55-36-00-400-801-A/ 400). (6) Set the gust lock system to the locked position.
