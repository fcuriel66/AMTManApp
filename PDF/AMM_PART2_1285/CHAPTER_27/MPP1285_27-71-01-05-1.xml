			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE ELEVATOR TRAVEL AREA. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Do not do other tasks in the horizontal stabilizer, elevators and rudders at this time. (3) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (4) (WITH GSE-419) Remove rear fairings 321 of the horizontal stabilizer. Refer to AMM TASK 55-36-00-000-801-A/400. (5) Make sure that the electromechanical gust-lock system is in the locked position. (6) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the GUST-LOCK circuit breaker and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (7) (WITHOUT GSE-419) Remove the relay K0848 (AMM TASK 20-13-02-000-801-A/ 400). (8) (WITH GSE-419) Disconnect the electrical connector of the Electromechanical Actuator from the aircraft harness. J. Electromechanical Actuator - Functional Check (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 020-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE RUDDER, THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AND THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE OPERATED ACCIDENTALLY. AN ACCIDENTAL OPERATION MAY CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. (1) (WITH GSE-419) Do the subsequent procedure to check the friction forces in the Electromechanical Gust-Lock Actuator (Figure 501). (a) Connect J3014 connector of GSE-419 to the electrical connector of the Electromechanical Actuator and P3014 connector of GSE-419 to the aircraft harness. (b) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the GUST-LOCK circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (c) Install GSE-050 to the bornes of GSE-419. (d) Do these steps three times. CAUTION: DO NOT APPLY TOO MUCH FORCE TO HOLD THE CONTROL COLUMN AGAINST THE BACKSTOPS, IN THE FULLY FORWARD POSITION, DURING THE UNLOCKING TRAVEL. 1 Move the control column to the fully forward position (nose down) and keep it thus during the unlocking travel. a Lift the handle and command the gust-lock lever from the locked position to the intermediate position and, with the aid of the digital EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-71-01 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
