Backlash of the Flap Surface SUBTASK 720-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (1) Use a dynamometer to apply an upward load of 30 kgf (66 lbf) to the inboard-flap trailing-edge. Write the deflection in Table 501. (2) Use a dynamometer to apply an downward load of 15 kgf (33 lbf) to the inboard-flap trailing edge. Write the deflection in Table 501. NOTE: Add all deflection values together, as positive, independently of their signal. Table 501 - INBOARD FLAP BACKLASH Inboard Flap Deflection (degrees) Applied Load Left Wing Right Wing 30 kgf up A A  (66 lbf) 15 kgf [1] down B B  (33 lbf) measured deflection   A + B A + B maximum deflection permit- 0.5 0.5 ted [1] When you measure the flap downward deflection, ignore the negative signal. (3) Remove the GSEs from the inboard flap. (4) Calculate the maximum deflection permitted. Use Table 501 for it. • The maximum deflection permitted is 0.5 degrees. • The measured deflection is A + B. (5) Do steps 1 thru 4 for the inboard flap of the right wing. Use Table 501 for it. (6) Do steps 1 thru 4 for the outboard flap of the left wing. Use Table 502 for it.
