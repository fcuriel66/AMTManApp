			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 27-53-04-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 2. FLAP ZERO-DEGREE RIGGING A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the zero-degree rigging of the flaps when you install the Flaps (AMM MPP 27-50-00/400), the Flap Actuators (AMM MPP 27-51-09/400 and AMM MPP 27-51-10/400).. (2) There are two ways to perform the zero-degree rigging procedures, with GSE-350 or without GSE-350. NOTE: The procedure with GSE-350 requires only one mechanic and has a shorter accomplishment time. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (5) Put the flap in the 45-degree position. (6) Clean the area around the FSA face (where screwjack goes into the gearbox) to remove the signs of leakage and old reference marks. (7) Open access panel 193AL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). CAUTION:WHEN YOU OPEN THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD, IF IT IS NECESSARY TO MOVE THE FLAPS, DO AS FOLLOWS (IT WILL PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD AND INBOARD-FLAP LEADING EDGE): • RELEASE THE SPRING FROM THE ROOT AND TIP SUPPORTS OF THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD. • REMOVE THE TIP AND ROOT SUPPORTS ONLY FROM THE INBOARD FLAP LOWER SHROUD (AMM TASK 57-56-01-000-801-A/400). (8) Open the flap lower shroud (AMM TASK 57-56-01-000-802-A/400). J. Flap Zero-Degree Rigging (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  (Figure 504)  (Figure 505)  SUBTASK 720-003-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (1) Flap pre-rigging: (a) Put the flap in the 22- or 45-degree position. (b) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (c) Remove the actuator gimbal pins of the outboard and inboard flap tip actuators (FSA 2 and FSA 4). Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-09-000-802-A/400 and AMM TASK 27-51-10-000-802-A/400. NOTE: The actuator gimbal pin must be easy to remove. (d) If the actuator gimbal pin is hard to remove, do the steps below: 1 Remove flap flexible shaft (FFS) section 5 from the flap actuator (of the outboard flap tip actuator - FSA 4). Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-08-000-801- A/400. 2 Remove flap flexible-shaft section 2 and section 3 from the flap actuator (of the inboard flap tip actuator - FSA 2). Refer to AMM TASK 27-51-05-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 27-51-06-000-801-A/400. 3 Turn the spindle clockwise or counterclockwise until the gimbal becomes free.

(2) Electrically release the Flap Transmission Brake (FTB): (a) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers. (b) Disconnect electrical connector P1104 (WM 27-53-01) from the FECU. (c) (For the LH FTB) Connect a jumper between pins 7 and 46 of electrical connector P1104 (WM 27-53-01). (d) (For the RH FTB) Connect a jumper between pins 115 and 128 of electrical connector P1104 (WM 27-53-01). (e) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers. (3) For Zero-Degree Rigging procedure with GSE-350, do the steps below: (a) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200), and install the GSE 066 to the ground spoiler (Figure 505). (b) Disconnect FFS section 1 from the FPDU ( AMM TASK 27-51-04-000-801-A/ 400). CAUTION:THE AVAILABLE OUTPUT TORQUE OF THE PNEUMATIC OR ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER MUST NOT BE HIGHER THAN 12 N.M (105 LBF.IN) TO PREVENT PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE FFS. (c) Use a pneumatic or electric screwdriver or use a wrench, with GSE-064, on the FFS section 1, to move the surface to a position slightly more than 9 degrees. NOTE: It is not necessary to measure the real position of the flap surfaces. (d) Install GSE-350 to the tracks of the flap. See Figure 501. NOTE: The thicker Gauge-Flap (GSE-350) shall be installed on the track of the flap actuator 2 that is located on the inboard flap surface. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE TRANSLATION SPEED OF THE FLAPS IS REDUCED WHEN THE SURFACES GET CLOSE TO THE ZERO- DEGREE POSITION. (e) Turn FFS section 1 to move the flap surfaces until they touch the stops of GSE-350. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-53-04 Page 5 of 14 Rev 54 - Apr 27/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
