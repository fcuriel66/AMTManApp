			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Make sure that hydraulic systems 1 and 2 are pressurized AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200. (3) Get access to the vertical stabilizer (GSE 036). (4) Open access panels 325AL, 325CL, 326AL, 326GL, 326HL, 327HR, 327ER, and 327FR, (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100, AMM MPP 52-40-04/400). J. Inspect (Detailed Inspection) Rudder Main Control Feedback Path, PCU Linkage and Mounting Points, Rudder Actuator Attachments, Rudder I/II Hinges and Connecting Rods (Figure 601)  (Figure 602)  (Figure 603)  (Figure 604)  (Figure 605)  (Figure 606)  (Figure 607)  (Figure 608)  (Figure 609)  (Figure 610)  SUBTASK 220-002-A WARNING:MAKE SURE THAT THE RUDDER CANNOT BE OPERATED ACCIDENTALLY. AN ACCIDENTAL OPERATION OF THE RUDDER CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. (1) Do an inspection on the rudder PCU connections and bearings for integrity, interference, and abnormal friction. Do this check while the rudder is commanded. (2) Release the pressure on hydraulic systems 1 and 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/ 200). (3) On the circuit breaker panel, open the RUDDER 1 and RUDDER 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. (4) Install the rig pins to the pedal assemblies, rear torque tube, and PCU. Refer to Figure 601. (5) Remove the control rod. Refer to AMM TASK 27-21-08-000-801-A/400. (a) Visually examine the control rod for integrity. (b) Hold the control rod in both ends (3) and (4) and pull, twist and flex it. Refer to Sheet 2, Figure 603. NOTE: If you find any relative movement between the rod body (2) and its rod ends (3) and (4), replace the control rod (1). (6) Do the step (5) for both rods. CAUTION: • DO NOT TIGHTEN OR LOOSEN THE ECCENTRIC PIN BY THE SCREW HEAD TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO IT. • USE A WRENCH TO LOOSEN THE ECCENTRIC PIN ON THE NUT ONLY TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO IT. (7) Remove concentric pins (7), (8), (9) and (14) and the eccentric pin (1). Refer to Figure 602, Sheet 2.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Mark the assembly position of each pin and related fasteners in the feedback rods. (8) Remove the feedback rods (15) and (20) and bellcranck (16). (9) Remove the inner shaft from the outer shaft at the eccentric pin and concentric pins. Refer to Figure 602, Sheet 3. NOTE: After this step, look and identify each pair of outer and inner shafts which include the eccentric and concentric pins sets to permit the correct assembly. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK). PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING; DO NOT BREATHE THE GAS OR DUST; DO THE WORK IN AN AREA THAT HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. THE METHYL ETHYL KETONE (MEK) IS POISONOUS AND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. (10) Clean area before you examine the parts, removing dust, grease, oil, sealants, and other contaminations from them. (11) Do a visual inspection on the rudder actuator attachment, PCU linkages and mounting points, Rudder-I Hinges, feedback rods, the eccentric pin, concentric pins and bellcrank for general condition and integrity. NOTE: • Use an inspection mirror to examine the parts, if necessary. • If you find defects, replace the defective parts. CAUTION: WHEN YOU ASSEMBLE EACH SET OF ECCENTRIC OR CONCENTRIC PINS, MAKE SURE THAT EACH PAIR OF INNER AND OUTER PINS AGREES WITH THE PAIR USED BEFORE AND THAT THE HOLES ALIGN CORRECTLY. (12) Assemble the set of the concentric pins and eccentric pin. WARNING: COR-BAN 27L IS TOXIC TO SKIN, EYES AND RESPIRATORY TRACT. USE PVC GLOVES AND EYE PROTECTION. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS. OBEY THE MANUFACTURERS' HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. (a) Apply COR-BAN 27L to the inner shaft. Use gloves and a brush. (b) Put the inner shafts into the outer shaft and attach them with a cotter pin. Refer to Figure 602, Sheet 3. (c) Apply COR-BAN 27L to the outer shaft. Use gloves and a brush. (13) Install the concentric pins (7), (8), (9) and (14) and eccentric pin (1) together with the feedback rods (15) and (20) and the bellcrank (16). Refer to Figure 602, Sheet 2. NOTE: To prevent damage to the eccentric pin, use a wrench to tighten the nut only. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE PINS ARE IN THEIR CORRECT POSITIONS TOGETHER WITH THEIR RELATED FASTENERS. (a) Install the eccentric pin (1) to the hinge with beveled washer (21), bushing (2), locking nut (3), washer (4), nut (5), and cotter pin (6), refer to DET G Figure 602, Sheet 3.
