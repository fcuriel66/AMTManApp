Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Vertical stabilizer 1 Does the task Cockpit I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS AND EQUIPMENT IN THE RUDDER TRAVEL AREA. (1) Release the pressure of the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (2) Get access to the vertical stabilizer. Open access door 325AL, 325CL and 325HR (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100). J. Functionally Check Rudder Power Control Unit/Actuators Differential Pressure (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-002-A WARNING: • THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. • MAKE SURE THAT THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM IS NOT PRESSURIZED. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL NO TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE PIN LOCK-RIGHT AND PIN LOCK-LEFT. (1) Disconnect the lower rudder feedback rod from the summing lever. See Figure 501. (2) Cut the lockwire from the bleed valves of the upper and lower actuators. (3) Install the hoses in the upper rudder actuator bleed valves. See Figure 501. NOTE: The hoses must be SKYDROL fluid-resistant and approved for 3500 psi. (4) Install the pressure gauges (3500 psig) to the two hoses. See Figure 501. (5) On the Flight Control Panel, make sure that the pushbuttons of rudder system 1 and rudder system 2 are off. (6) Pressurize hydraulic system 1 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS IN THE RUDDER TRAVEL AREA BECAUSE, WHEN YOU TURN ON RUDDER SYSTEM 1, THE RUDDER WILL MOVE UNTIL IT REACHES ITS STOP. (7) Turn on rudder system 1. (8) Open the bleed valves of the upper actuator 1/4 of turn. (9) Manually move the rudder fully to the left and fully to the right to cycle the rudder system, two times. For this, use the summing lever. (10) Manually operate the summing lever up to its stop to move the rudder to the full left position. Refer to Figure 501. NOTE: Make sure that the lower feedback rod is disconnected from the summing lever. (11) Write down the values shown on the pressure gauges and calculate the differential pressure. Pa=___________ psi Pb=___________ psi ΔP=|___________| psi (12) Make sure that the differential pressure between the pressure gauges is ≥ 2700 psi. (13) Manually move the rudder fully to the left and fully to the right to cycle the rudder system, two times. For this, use the summing lever. (14) Manually operate the summing lever down to its stop to move the rudder to the full right position. Refer to Figure 501. NOTE: Make sure that the lower feedback rod is disconnected from the summing lever. (15) Write down the values shown on the pressure gauges and calculate the differential pressure. Pa=___________ psi Pb=___________ psi ΔP=|___________| psi (16) Make sure that the differential pressure between the pressure gauges is ≥ 2700 psi. (17) Turn off rudder system 1 and release the pressure of hydraulic system 1 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). CAUTION: IF YOU APPLY TOO MUCH TORQUE OR IF THE TORQUE VALUE IS BELOW THE SPECIFIED VALUE, LOSS OF THE APPLICABLE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CAN OCCUR. (18) Close the bleed valves. Apply a torque of 3.5 - 4.5 N.m (31 - 40 lbf.in). See Figure 501. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-22-01 Page 4 of 8 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (19) Remove the hoses (Figure 501) from the upper rudder actuator hydraulic service lines. (20) Do a check on the bleed valves to make sure that the torque applied is 3.5 - 4.5 N.m (31 - 40 lbf.in). (21) Install the hoses on the lower actuator. (22) Open the bleed valves of the lower rudder actuator 1/4 of turn. (23) Pressurize hydraulic system 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS IN THE RUDDER TRAVEL AREA BECAUSE, WHEN YOU TURN ON RUDDER SYSTEM 2, THE RUDDER WILL MOVE UNTIL IT REACHES ITS STOP. (24) Turn on rudder system 2. (25) Do steps 9 thru 20 again for the lower rudder actuator. Use hydraulic system 2 and rudder system 2. (26) Bleed the rudder actuators (AMM TASK 27-22-00-870-801-A/300). CAUTION: SAFETY THE BLEED VALVE TO PREVENT ITS OPENING IN FLIGHT. (27) Safety the bleed valves of the two rudder actuators. See (Figure 501). (28) Turn off rudder system 2 and release the pressure of hydraulic system 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A CAUTION: BE CAREFUL NO TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE PIN LOCK-RIGHT AND PIN LOCK-LEFT. (1) Connect the lower rudder feedback rod to the summing lever and to the bellcrank. See Figure 501. (2) Close access door 325AL, 325CL and 325HR (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100). (3) Remove platform GSE 036.
