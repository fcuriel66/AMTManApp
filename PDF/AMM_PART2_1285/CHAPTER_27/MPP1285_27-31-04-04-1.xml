			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (6) Install bolt (16), washer (15) and the end of the bonding strap (3) to the support (14) at the elevator structure. Refer to DET. C. WARNING: USE EYE PROTECTION WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL LOCKWIRE OR SAFETY CABLE. IF YOU DO NOT USE EYE PROTECTION, CUT PIECES OF WIRE CAN HIT YOUR EYES AND CAUSE INJURY. (7) Torque the bolt (16) and safety it with the other bolts the support (14) at the elevator structure with lockwire (17). Refer to DET. C. (8) Install the bolt (23), two washers (22), two bushings (21), and nut (19) to connect the hinge (20) of the servo tab (1) to the support (14) at the elevator structure. Refer to DET. C. (9) Make sure that the threads of the nut (11) and bolt (7) fully engage. The base of the nut (11) must not touch the surface. (10) Turn the nut (11) and measure the locking torque with a torque wrench. (11) Make sure that the locking torque value is 0.23 - 2.04 N.m (2 - 18 lb.in). NOTE: If you find a nut that is not in the correct range, you must replace it. (12) Add the locking torque value measured to the standard torque of 1.7 - 2.3 N.m (15 - 20 lb.in) to get the final torque. (13) Apply the final torque to the nut (11) with a torque wrench, as follows: (a) Tighten the nut (11) to the bolt (7) to remove clearance. (b) Torque the nut (11) with the minimum final torque value. Continue to torque as necessary to align the slot in the nut (11) with the cotter pin (12) hole in the bolt (7). NOTE: Be careful not to apply more than the maximum final torque value. (c) Safety the nut (11) to the bolt (7) with a new cotter pin (12). (14) Make sure that the threads of the nut (19) and bolt (23) fully engage. The base of the nut (19) must not touch the surface. (15) Turn the nut (19) and measure the locking torque with a torque wrench. (16) Make sure that the locking torque value is 0.23 - 2.04 N.m (2 - 18 lb.in). NOTE: If you find a nut that is not in the correct range, you must replace it. (17) Add the locking torque value measured to the standard torque of 1.7 - 2.3 N.m (15 - 20 lb.in) to get the final torque.

(20) Turn the nut (29) and measure the locking torque with a torque wrench. (21) Make sure that the locking torque value is 0.39 - 3.39 N.m (3.5 - 30 lb.in). NOTE: If you find a nut that is not in the correct range, you must replace it. (22) Add the locking torque value measured to the standard torque of 5.6 - 6.77 N.m (50 - 60 lb.in) to get the final torque. (23) Apply the final torque to the nut (29) with a torque wrench, as follows: (a) Tighten the nut (29) to the bolt (39) to remove clearance. (b) Torque the nut (29) with the minimum final torque value. Continue to torque as necessary to align the slot in the nut (29) with the cotter pin (28) hole in the bolt (39).

Refer to DET. D. (25) If necessary, connect the bonding straps (2) and (3) to the support at the servo tab (1) with the screw (24), three washers, and nut. Refer to DET. F. NOTE: Refer to AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200 for the correct installation of the bonding straps (2) and (3). (26) Do the bonding test (AMM TASK 20-13-21-700-801-A/200). (27) Do the bonding protection ( AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-802-A/200). (28) Install the fairing (40) ( AMM TASK 55-14-00-400-801-A/400). Refer to DET. G. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) If you replaced the servo tab by a different one do the Elevator Balancing Check ( AMM TASK 51-60-00-700-801-A/500). NOTE: It is not necessary to do the Elevator Balancing Check when you install the same servo tab in the same elevator assembly. (2) Measure the backlash of the servo tab (AMM TASK 27-31-00-700-801-A/500). NOTE: • Do not measure the spring tab and elevator backlashes.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Do this step only if you replaced the servo tab with a new one or if you replaced it with a servo tab used on other aircraft. (3) Do the operational check on the servo tabs (AMM TASK 27-31-04-700-801-A/500). (4) Do the calibration of the Elevator with Control Column Position Transducer ( AMM TASK 27-30-00-700-801-A/500). NOTE: Do the calibration procedure ( AMM TASK 27-30-00-700-801-A/500) only if you replaced the servo tab with a new one or if you replaced it with a servo tab used on other aircraft. Do not do the procedure when the same servo tab is installed again on the same aircraft. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 27-31-04 Page 9 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
