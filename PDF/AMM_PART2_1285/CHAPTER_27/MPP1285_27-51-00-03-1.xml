			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Do not do other tasks on the flap system. (3) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (4) Set the flaps to the 45-degree position. (5) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. J. Lubricate Flap Screwjack Actuator (FSAs) (Figure 301)  SUBTASK 640-002-A CAUTION:HANDLE THE GREASE GUN CAREFULLY TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE GREASE FITTING. (1) Get access to the right wing and left wing flap actuators. NOTE: For outboard root actuators and inboard tip actuators, remove the protection cover ( AMM TASK 27-51-09-000-802-A/400). (2) It is permissible to lubricate the screwjack actuator gimbal with any of the greases identified herein from specification MIL-PRF-81322. Do the following steps: (a) Clean the ballscrew assy nut fitting with a clean cloth. (b) Position the grease gun nozzle in the gimbal nipple in a vertical direction (Refer to sheet 3, Figure 301). (c) Push the grease gun full travel, again and again, with both hands, against the nipple (Refer to sheet 3, Figure 301), until all the old grease leaks through the nut/screw interface and you can see the new grease. NOTE: After you lubricate the flap actuator, grease leakage can occur during the first cycles of operation of the flap. (d) After you apply the grease, remove the excess from the nipple and from the ballscrew. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the access of the right wing and left wing flap actuators. NOTE: For outboard root actuators and inboard tip actuators, install the protection cover ( AMM TASK 27-51-09-400-802-A/400).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL b If it is necessary to remove the excess grease buildup, squirt solvent into the end fittings of the core and use a nylon-bristle brush to loosen built-up grease and debris. WARNING: WEAR EYE PROTECTION WHEN USING COMPRESSED AIR TO BLOW OUT THE EXCESS GREASE. c Rinse the FFS casing with clean solvent and dry with compressed air. NOTE: The solvent will not dissolve the grease, but will loosen its hold so that the brush and air will remove most of it. Remaining residue is acceptable. 2 Core: a Wipe off the exterior surface with a dry paper towel or lint-free cloth until the core leaves no visible residue deposits on the paper towel or cloth. NOTE: • Do not immerse the core in solvent. • The core consists of many strands of metal wire with spaces between them that hold the grease. Do not try to remove all of the grease between the strands of wire. • Do not use compressed air to remove old lubrication. (f) Do AMM TASK 27-51-00-200-802-A/600 for the external/internal inspection of the FFS. (g) You can lubricate the FFS with: 1 Grease Aeroshell 33. For this, go to step (h); or 2 Corrosion inhibiting compound Cor-Ban 22. For this, go to step (i). (h) Apply grease to the core as follows: CAUTION: LEAVE ONLY A THIN RESIDUE OF GREASE ON THE INNER CORE FOR CORROSION PROTECTION. EXCESS GREASE CAN INCREASE DRAG AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE FLAP CONTROL SYSTEM. 1 Apply a thin film of grease to the inner core. 2 Wrap a lint-free cloth or paper towel around the core and slide it down the length of the core to strip off excess grease so that no visible build-up exists beyond the crevices between the strands of wire and only a shiny residue remains. NOTE: Leave only a shining residue of grease on the inner core with no visible build-up beyond the crevices between the strands of wire. 3 Apply a very thin film of grease to the washer.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Before remove the drain plug put a suitable container under the drain port to collect the oil. (3) Clean the area around the fill plug (2). (4) Remove the fill plug (2), drain plug (3), and discard related preformed packing (4) from the FSA. Refer to Figure 303 - Sheet 1. (5) Check for metallic particles at both plugs (fill and drain). Refer to Figure 303 - Sheet 3. If particles are detected, replace the actuator as required. Refer to AMM MPP 27-51-09/400 or AMM MPP 27-51-10/400. NOTE: The metallic paste that you can find on the plugs is not a failure. It is a result of the mixture of hydraulic fluid 5606 with molybdenum disulphide. Do not think of this as metallic particles. (6) Drain all oil from the FSA. NOTE: An amount of oil remains under the drain port level. (7) Clean the FSA reservoir as follows: • Using hydraulic fluid MIL-PRF-5606, flush it through the fill port until clean fluid comes out from drain port. Wait until the drop rate is about 1 drop/10 sec to ensure the unit is completely empty. (8) Clean the drain plug (3). Refer to Figure 303 - Sheet 1. (9) Wet the new preformed packing (4) with oil MIL-PRF-5606 and install it on the drain plug (3). Refer to Figure 303 - Sheet 1. (10) Install the drain plug (3) to the FSA. Torque tighten the drain plug (3) to 3 ÃÂ± 0.3 N.m (26.5 ÃÂ± 3 lbf.in). Refer to Figure 303 - Sheet 1. 3 (11) Insert a mixture of lubricant 25 cm , using 10% by weight of Molybdenum Disulphide added to the hydraulic fluid MIL-PRF-5606 into the FSA. Refer to Figure 303 - Sheet 2. (12) Wet the new preformed packing (4) with oil MIL-PRF-5606 and install it on the fill plug (2). Refer to Figure 303 - Sheet 1. (13) Install the fill plug (2) to the FSA. Torque tighten the fill plug (3) to 3 ÃÂ± 0.3 N.m (26.5 ÃÂ± 3 lbf.in). Refer to Figure 303. (14) Clean the area around the FSA face (where screwjack goes into the gearbox) to make sure that no oil remains. (15) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and remove a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them. (16) Cycle flaps full down an then full up (5 cycles). (17) Inspect the FSA face for signs of leakage and make sure that the sign of leakage is not sufficient to form a drop of fluid . NOTE: If there is leakage on the FSA face, replace the actuator.
