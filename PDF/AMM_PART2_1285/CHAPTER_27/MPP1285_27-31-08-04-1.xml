(14) Apply the final torque to the nut (24) with a torque wrench, as follows: (a) Tighten the nut (24) to the bolt (27) to remove clearance. (b) Torque the nut (24) with the minimum final torque value. Continue to torque as necessary to align the slot in the nut (24) with the cotter pin (23) hole in the bolt (27). NOTE: Be careful not to apply more than the maximum final torque value. (c) Safety the nut (24) to the bolt (27) with a new cotter pin (23).

NOTE: It is not necessary to do the Elevator Balancing Check when you install the same spring tab in the same elevator assembly. (2) Measure the backlash of the spring tab (AMM TASK 27-31-00-700-801-A/500). NOTE: • Do not measure the servo tab and elevator backlashes. • Do this step only if you replaced the spring tab with a new one or if you replaced it with a spring tab used on other aircraft. (3) Do the operational check on the servo tabs (AMM TASK 27-31-04-700-801-A/500). (4) Do the check of the adjustment of the backstop of the spring tabs ( AMM TASK 27-31-08-700-801-A/500).
