			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (6) Install the rig pins (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) to the PCU, pedals, and torque tubes (Figure 502, Figure 503, or Figure 504). (7) Make sure that the rudder secondary backstops are correctly adjusted according to AMM TASK 27-20-00-700-803-A/500. (8) Energize the aircraft with the external DC power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (9) Make sure that the yaw trim indicator, on the EICAS, shows zero position. (10) Pressurize hydraulic system 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). J. Adjustment of the Rudder Neutral Position (Figure 505)  (Figure 506)  (Figure 509)  SUBTASK 720-002-A WARNING: • MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE TRAVEL AREA. • OBEY ALL SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO SKYDROL FLUID. (1) Do a check of the rudder neutral position, as follows: (a) Remove two screws from the access panel 325AL, as shown in Figure 506. NOTE: You must remove exactly the same screws as shown in Figure 506. (b) Install the supporting straight edge (GSE 069) in the two points given in the step above. (c) Install the gauge setting (GSE 336) as shown in Figure 506. (d) Make sure that the rudder is in the neutral position. NOTE: The rudder is in the neutral position when the rudder II trailing edge centerline is between the zero degree limit marks of the gauge setting with a tolerance of ÃÂ± 1 degree. (e) If the rudder is in the neutral position, remove the supporting straight edge and the gauge setting, install the two screws to access panel 325AL, and go to step (2). If it is not, do the adjustment as follows: 1 Remove the cotter pins (5) and (6), nut (4), and washer (3) to remove the eccentric pin lock (2) (Figure 505). 2 Turn the eccentric pin until you align the rudder II trailing edge with the mark of the gauge setting. If the eccentric pin could not provide enough adjustment to align the rudder, and it remains deflected to the right side by 0.5 degree max, do as follows: a Fabricate one solid shim made from Al-2024-T3, 1.0 mm thick, profiled to follow base contour of fitting support, finished with alodine and primer. Install shim between fitting support and structure with one fillet of sealant, fasten in position using original bolts (Figure 509). NOTE: Make sure that, at the end of the adjustment, the spherical bearing rod end contour is inside the pair of fittings, with no EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-20-00 Page 4 of 25 Rev 52 - Apr 28/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL protrusion. If does not, turn the eccentric pin 180ÃÂº to put the spherical bearing rod end to the inside of the pair of fitting, and do the adjustment again if necessary. 3 Install a lock to the eccentric pin and, if necessary, slowly turn the eccentric pin to permit the lock installation. 4 Attach the lock (2) to the eccentric pin (1) with the nut (4), washer (3), and cotter pins (5) and (6) (Figure 505) and make sure that the stop pins are correctly installed. 5 Remove the supporting straight edge, the gauge setting, and install the two screws to panel 325AL.
