Preparation SUBTASK 841-010-D CAUTION: EMBRAER RECOMMENDS: THE AIRCRAFT MUST STAY IN THE HANGAR AND ON GROUND. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Do not do other tasks on the aircraft because it will cause error on the surface position measurement. (3) Energize the aircraft with the external DC power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). WARNING: THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (4) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (5) Make sure that the RUDDER SHUTOFF SYS 1 and RUDDER SHUTOFF SYS 2 pushbutton lights, installed on the Overhead Panel, are on. The EICAS display shows the RUDDER SYS 1-2 INOP caution message. (6) Cycle 10 times the rudder surface and stop the surface in the neutral position after the last cycle. (7) On the Overhead Panel, push the RUDDER SHUTOFF SYS 1 pushbutton, to turn on rudder system 1. • Make sure that the pushbutton light goes off. The EICAS display shows the RUDDER SYS 2 INOP caution message. (8) Make sure that the yaw trim indicator, on the EICAS, shows zero position. (9) On the circuit breaker panel, open the YAW TRIM circuit breaker and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to it. (10) Remove cockpit underfloor access hatch 123BL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (11) Remove the pedal assembly linings ( AMM TASK 25-12-06-000-801-A/400). (12) Put the rudder pedals in the neutral position and install the rig pins (Figure 502).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (13) Remove the two screws that attach access panel 325AL to attach the straight edge GSE 069, as shown in DET. B (Figure 501). (14) Do a check of the rudder neutral position, as follows: (a) Install the gauge (GSE 336) using the rivet row as reference as shown in DET. E (Figure 501). (b) The rudder is in the neutral position when the rudder II trailing edge centerline is between the zero degree limit marks of the gauge setting with a tolerance of ÃÂ± 1 degree. (c) If the rudder is in the neutral position, remove the gauge setting. If it is not, do ( AMM TASK 27-20-00-700-801-A/500). (15) Install the dial indicator (GSE 489) as shown in DET. D (Figure 501). NOTE: The dial indicator stylus must be perpendicular to the rudder surface. (16) Adjust the dial indicator in its mid-scale position. (17) Install the dynamometer attachment device (GSE 069) on the rudder- ΙΙ trailing edge as shown in DET. C (Figure 501). J. Functionally Check Rudder Backlash (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-010-D (1) Set the dial indicator to zero (2) Start to apply the load to the left. Let the rudder move to the left until you have a limit load of 25 kgf (55 lbf). (3) Measure the displacement only for 10 kgf (22 lbf) and 20 kgf (44 lbf) positions, and write down in (Table 501) the values shown on the dial indicator for cycle 1. (4) Slowly start to decrease the load applied to it. Let the rudder go back to the neutral position. (5) Measure the displacement only for 20 kgf (44 lbf) and 10 kgf (22 lbf) positions, and write down in (Table 501) the values shown on the dial indicator for cycle 1. (6) Start to apply the load to the right. Let the rudder move to the right until you have a limit load of 25 kgf (55 lbf). (7) Measure the displacement only for 10 kgf (22 lbf) and 20 kgf (44 lbf) positions, and write down in (Table 501) the values shown on the dial indicator for cycle 1. (8) Slowly start to decrease the load applied to it. Let the rudder go back to the neutral position. (9) Measure the displacement only for 20 kgf (44 lbf) and 10 kgf (22 lbf) positions, and write down in (Table 501) the values shown on the dial indicator for cycle 1. (10) Remove the dynamometer from the attachment device. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 CONFIG-2 27-22-00 Page 4 of 12 Rev 49 - Feb  16/16 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

GC = (G1 + G2)/2 • Calculate the G values for each of the three cycles and find the average value between them as follows: 1. G = (GA + GB + GC)/3 (d) The G value is the rudder backlash. The maximum value permitted for the rudder backlash is 3.82 mm (0.1504 in) Table 503 - MAXIMUM PERMITTED RUDDER BACKLASH MAXIMUM PERMITTED RUDDER BACKLASH mm (in) 3.82 mm 0.1504 in NOTE: If the value found is out of the limit, refer to FIM TASK 27-22-00-810-807-A. (15) (Only if the GSE 378 is available) For each cycle, find the backlash as follows: • Enter in the software with values of the Cycles 1, 2, and 3 indicated in the table 501. • Check the value of the Rudder Backlash according to the Table 503. (16) Turn on rudder system 2 and make sure that the pushbutton light goes off. (17) Turn off rudder system 1 and make sure that the pushbutton light comes on. (18) Do steps (1) thru (15) for hydraulic system 2. (19) Turn off hydraulic system 2 and make sure that the pushbutton light goes off.
