(l) Move the control column to the rearward position (nose up), beyond the neural point, and keep it thus. (m) Lift the handle and command the gust lock lever to the locked position. NOTE: Make sure that the control column can be moved fully rearward (nose up) and fully forward (nose down). (n) On the circuit breaker panel, close the AIR/GND D circuit breaker to simulate ground condition. (o) Push the control columns fully forward and make sure of the following conditions: NOTE: • The two control columns are locked, but small deflections are possible because of the system flexibility. • The elevator deflections are limited to the dimensional tolerance between the locking mechanism (spring cartridge) and the elevator lateral fitting holes. • The engine power control levers cannot move beyond the ground maneuver setting. (5) (FOR AIRCRAFT POST-MOD. S.B.145-27-0101) Do the operational check of the indication relay K1013 as follows: (a) Make sure that the gust lock lever is at the locked position. (b) Lift the gust lock handle and move the gust lock lever to the intermediate position. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-803-A/500 27-71-00 Page 14 of 20 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 1 (FOR AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD. S.B.145-27-0125) The gust lock indication light comes on and stays on for approximately eight seconds after the gust lock lever is set to the intermediate position, during the unlocking cycle. 2 (FOR AIRCRAFT POST-MOD. S.B.145-27-0125) The gust lock indication light comes on and stays on for approximately eight seconds after the gust lock lever is set to the intermediate position, during the unlocking cycle. After the unlocking cycle, the gust lock light starts to blink. (6) (FOR AIRCRAFT POST-MOD. S.B.145-27-0125) Do the operational check of the indication relays K1706 and K1707 as follows: (a) Make sure that the gust lock lever is at the intermediate position. 1 The gust lock light stays blinking. (b) Push the control columns forward, to the full nose down position. (c) Lift the handle and command the gust lock lever to the unlocked position. 1 After the gust lock lever get to the unlocked position, the gust lock light stops to blink and the light goes off. (7) (FOR AIRCRAFT POST-MOD. S.B.145-27-0101) Do the operational check of the engine 1 and engine 2 thrust lever switches (automatic unlock system) as follows: (a) Make sure that the gust lock lever is at the locked position. (b) Make sure that the control columns are locked, but small deflections are possible because of the system flexibility. (c) On the gust lock lever, remove the screws (1) and (3) and the gust lock cross bar (2), as applicable. Refer to Figure 502 or Figure 503. (d) Set engine 1 thrust lever to a position more than 59ÃÂ°. 1 The gust lock indication light comes on. 2 Make sure that the control columns are locked, but small deflections are possible because of the system flexibility. (e) Set engine 1 thrust lever back to zero degree position. 1 The gust lock indication light goes off. 2 Make sure that the control columns are locked, but small deflections are possible because of the system flexibility. (f) Set engine 2 thrust lever to a position more than 59ÃÂ°. 1 The gust lock indication light does not come on. 2 Move the control column to the full nose up position and back to the full nose down position. The control columns must be free to move. (g) Set engine 2 thrust lever back to zero degree position.

S.B.145-27-0101) Do the operational check of the AIR Ground relay K1168 as follows: (a) Lift the gust lock handle and move the gust lock lever to the intermediate position. 1 (FOR AIRCRAFT PRE-MOD. S.B.145-27-0125) The gust lock light comes on for approximately 8 seconds after the gust lock lever is at the intermediate position. After this time, the gust lock light goes off and the elevators are free, but the gust lock lever cannot be moved from the intermediate to the unlocked position. 2 (FOR AIRCRAFT POST-MOD.
