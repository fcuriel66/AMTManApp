			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Release the pressure of the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (3) Do not do other tasks on the Speed Brake and Flap System. (4) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (5) Set the flaps to the 45-degree position. (6) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1, FLAP 2, SPEED BRAKE, GND SPLR INBD/OUTBD, ELEC PUMP 1, and ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO- NOT-CLOSE tag to them. CAUTION:WHEN YOU OPEN THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD, IF IT IS NECESSARY TO MOVE THE FLAPS, DO AS FOLLOWS (IT WILL PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD AND INBOARD-FLAP LEADING EDGE): • RELEASE THE SPRINGS FROM THE ROOT AND TIP SUPPORTS OF THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD. • REMOVE THE TIP AND ROOT SUPPORTS ONLY FROM THE INBOARD- FLAP LOWER SHROUD (AMM TASK 57-56-01-000-801-A/400).

THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. CAUTION: WHEN YOU REMOVE THE SPOILER ACTUATOR, LIFT THE SPOILER PANEL BEFORE YOU MOVE THE FLAP TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE SPOILER PANEL AND INBOARD FLAP LEADING EDGE. (1) Remove and discard the cotterpin (10). Remove the nut (14), bolt (3), washer (2), and bushing (15) to remove the actuator from the Speed Brake panel (1). (2) Remove and discard the cotterpin (10). Remove the nut (9), bolt (6), washer (5), and bushing (8) to remove the actuator from the wing attachment (7).

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Speed Brake I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Drain the storage fluid from the Speed Brake actuator. Keep the caps installed. J. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A • WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM IS NOT PRESSURIZED ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). • THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. NOTE: The installation area must be clean to avoid system contamination. WARNING: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THE COR-BAN 27L CORROSION- INHIBITING COMPOUND. PUT ON SAFETY GOGGLES AND PROTECTIVECLOTHING. DO NOT BREATHE THE GAS OR DUST. DO THE WORK IN ANAREA WHICH HAS A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. COR-BAN 27L IS POISONOUSAND HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. (1) Apply corrosion-inhibiting compound COR-BAN 27L to the bolt (3), washer (2), bushing (15), nut (14), and cotterpin (10) to install the actuator (4) on the Speed Brake panel (1). Apply the torques as given in (Figure 401). NOTE: • Install the Speed Brake actuator retracted and locked. • The inboard flap surface and spoiler panels may be in contact, but not stressed.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Apply corrosion-inhibiting compound COR-BAN 27L to the bolt (6), washer (5), bushing (8), and nut (9) to install the actuator on the wing attachment (7). Apply the torques as given in (Figure 401). Install the cotterpin (10). (3) Install the o'ring (13) on the union (11). (4) NOTE: Use the hydraulic fluid of the spoiler system to lubricate fittings and retaining rings to make the installation of the hose easier. Install the union (11) in the actuator (4). Apply the torques as given in (Figure 401). (5) NOTE: Hoses and fittings components must show no imperfections or defects. Before the installation of the hose do a visual inspection on fitting ends, threads, retaining surfaces and protection braids for failures, scratches, broken strings or cuts. CAUTION: IF THE HOSE IS TWISTED WHEN YOU INSTALL IT OR WHEN YOU APPLY TORQUE TO IT, LEAKAGES MAY OCCUR. TO PREVENT TWISTING OF THE HOSE, MAKE SURE THAT THE SWIVEL NUT IS MANUALLY ALIGNED AND TIGHTENED UNTIL YOU GET A METAL-TO-METAL CONTACT. (6) NOTE: If the hose is new, make sure that the hose ends protection is removed only right before the start of the installation procedures. Install the hydraulic hoses (12) in the actuator (4). Apply the torques as given in (Figure 401). (7) Do the adjustment/test of the spoiler surface (AMM TASK 27-63-01-700-802-A/500). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the lower shroud of the inboard flap (AMM TASK 57-56-01-400-801-A/400). NOTE: If you removed the tip and root supports from the inboard-flap lower shroud, install them now (AMM TASK 57-56-01-400-801-A/400). (2) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the FLAP 1, FLAP 2, SPEED BRAKE, GND SPLR INBD/OUTBD, ELEC PUMP 1, and ELEC PUMP 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them. (3) Set the flaps to the 0-degree position. (4) Bleed the air from the hydraulic system lines ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-803-A/200). (5) Make sure that there are no leaks in the speed brake actuator. (6) Do the operational check of the spoiler system ( AMM TASK 27-63-01-700-801-A/500). (7) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
