Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS AND EQUIPMENT IN THE AILERON TRAVEL AREA. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Do not do other tasks on the aileron system. (3) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (4) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-13-00 Page 2 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (5) On the Flight Control Panel (Overhead Panel), make sure that the pushbutton lights of the AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 and AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 2 are on. (6) Make sure that the EICAS display shows the AIL SYS 1 - 2 INOP message. J. Operationally Check Aileron Solenoid-Manifold-Shutoff Function (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do a check of the aileron solenoid-manifold-shutoff function with both system on, as follows: (a) Push the AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 and AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 2 pushbuttons, on the Flight Controls Panel. Result: 1 The pushbutton lights go off. 2 On the EICAS display, the AIL SYS 1 - 2 INOP caution message goes out of view. (b) Move the left control yoke fully to the left and to the right and then move it to the neutral position. Result: 1 The aileron surfaces move freely and no heavy load is felt on the control yoke. (2) Do a check of the aileron solenoid-manifold-shutoff function with the hydraulic system 1 off, as follows: (a) Push the AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 pushbutton, on the Flight Controls Panel. Result: 1 The pushbutton light comes on. 2 The EICAS display shows the AIL SYS 1 INOP caution message. (b) Move the left control yoke fully to the left and to the right and then move it to the neutral position. Result: 1 The aileron surfaces move freely and no heavy load is felt on the control yoke. (3) Turn on the hydraulic system 1 as follows: (a) Push the AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 pushbutton, on the Flight Controls Panel. Result: 1 The pushbutton light goes off. 2 On the EICAS display, the AIL SYS 1 INOP caution message goes out of view. (4) Do a check of the aileron solenoid-manifold-shutoff function, with the hydraulic system 2 off, as follows: (a) Push the AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 2 pushbutton, on the Flight Controls Panel. Result: 1 The pushbutton light comes on. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-13-00 Page 3 of 5 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 The EICAS display shows the AIL SYS 2 INOP caution message. (b) Move the left control yoke fully to the left and to the right and then move it to the neutral position. Result: 1 The aileron surfaces move free and no heavy load is felt on the control yoke. (5) Turn on the hydraulic system 2 as follows: (a) Push the AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 2 pushbutton, on the Flight Controls Panel. Result: 1 The pushbutton light goes off. 2 On the EICAS display, the AIL SYS 2 INOP caution message goes out of view. (6) Do a check of the aileron solenoid shutoff function with both system off, as follows: (a) Push the AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 and AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 2 pushbuttons on the Flight Controls Panel Result: 1 The pushbuttons lights come on. 2 The EICAS display shows the AIL SYS 1-2 INOP caution message. (b) Move the left or right control yoke fully to the left and to the right and then move it to the neutral position. Result: 1 The aileron surfaces move freely, but you must apply much force to move the control yoke. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Release the pressure of the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (2) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
