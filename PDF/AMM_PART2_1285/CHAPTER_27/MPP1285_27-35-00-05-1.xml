			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE ELEVATOR TRAVEL AREA. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Remove cockpit underfloor access hatch 123BL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) to get access to the elevator torque tube. (3) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (4) Make sure that the elevator control column, elevator torque tube, elevator rear sector, and elevator surface are not rig pinned. J. Operationally Check Elevator Disconnect System (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE ELEVATOR TRAVEL AREA. (1) Do the check of the Elevator Control System Connection: (a) Push the left control column forward and the right control column rearward. Result: 1 There must be no relative movement between the two columns. (b) Push the left control column rearward and the right control column forward. Result: 1 There must be no relative movement between the two columns. (2) Do the check of the tension of the Internal Cable (Figure 503). (a) The internal cable must be loose. (b) If the internal cable is tensioned, decrease its tension with the conduit terminal (Figure 503). (3) Disconnect the Elevator Control System by pulling the elevator disconnect handle. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. NOTE: The elevator disconnect handle is located on left side of the control pedestal. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. (a) The elevator amber caution light of the system comes on, which indicates a system disconnection. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. NOTE: Make sure that the elevator amber caution light is on LH side of the control stand, below the elevator disconnect handle that is installed vertically. If the elevator amber caution light is not installed correctly, probably occurred a swapping position with the aileron caution light. If the light EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-35-00 Page 3 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A. All rights reserved - See title page for details.</data>

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL positions between elevator and aileron are inverted do the TASK 76-11-01-000-801-A and install them accordingly. (4) Push the elevator disconnect handle back to its position at the control pedestal. NOTE: The elevator disconnect handle is located on left side of the control pedestal. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. (a) The elevator amber caution light of the system stays on. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. (5) Do step (1) again, and make sure that the control column movements are independent. (6) Make sure that disconnectable link grooves with black mark are aligned. (7) Install tool GSE 068 between the connecting flange (1) and the floating plate (2) of the Disconnectable Link, refer to Figure 502, DET. C. (8) Turn the tool until you hear the mechanical click. (a) The elevator amber caution light of the system goes off. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. (9) Continue to turn the tool, until you feel a moderate resistance. Do not remove the tool. (10) Operate the disconnection system with the elevator disconnect handle at the control pedestal five to ten times. NOTE: The elevator disconnect handle is located on left side of the control pedestal. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. (a) The elevator amber caution light of the system comes on when you pull the handle. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. NOTE: Make sure that the elevator amber caution light is on LH side of the control stand, below the elevator disconnect handle that is installed vertically. If the elevator amber caution light is not installed correctly, probably occurred a swapping position with the aileron caution light. If the light positions between elevator and aileron are inverted do the AMM TASK 76-11-01-000-801-A/400 and install them accordingly. (b) The elevator amber caution light of the system goes off when you push the elevator disconnect handle. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. (c) If it does not go off, turn the tool one more time until it goes off. NOTE: Do not continue to turn the tool if you feel too much resistance. (11) Push the elevator disconnect handle back to its position at the control pedestal. NOTE: The elevator disconnect handle is located on left side of the control pedestal. Refer to Figure 501, DET. C. (a) The elevator amber caution light of the system goes off. Refer to Figure 501, DET C. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-35-00 Page 4 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove tool GSE 068 from the Disconnectable Link. (2) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations of the Aircraft Maintenance Program. (3) Install cockpit underfloor access hatch 123BL (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (4) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
