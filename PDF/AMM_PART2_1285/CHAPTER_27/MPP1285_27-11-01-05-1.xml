(7) Remove access doors 551CB and 651CB ( AMM MPP 06-44-00/100) to get access to the wing aileron sectors. (8) Remove the floor panels listed below (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100): • 221GF to get access to the aileron torque tube and autopilot-servo cables. • 241DF and 251BF to get access to the aileron control cables in the fuselage. • 221EF and 222FF to get access to the aileron control cables that connect the control yoke to the aileron torque tube (forward torque tube). (9) Remove cockpit underfloor access hatch 123BL AMM MPP 06-41-01/100. (10) Install the rig pins (GSE 058) to the control yoke, aileron torque tube, elevator torque tube, aileron fuselage sector and aileron wing sector. Refer to Figure 501. NOTE: Make sure that the rig pins moves freely. J. Functionally Check of Aileron Control Cables Tension (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-027-B CAUTION: • DO NOT OPERATE THE AILERON SYSTEM WITH THE RIG PINS INSTALLED. IF YOU DO, THE RIGGING HOLES/PINS WILL BE DAMAGED. • TURN THE BARREL OF THE TURNBUCKLE TO APPLY TENSION TO THE CONTROL CABLE. DO NOT TURN THE CONTROL CABLE TO TENSION IT. (1) Measure the temperature on the 5/32-inch control cables that connect the control yoke to the aileron torque tube (forward torque tube). NOTE: • You must adjust the aileron control cables with the aircraft parked for a minimum of one hour in the hangar. • To measure the temperature, you must put the thermometer near the control cable circuit. Let the thermometer stay in position for a minimum of 5 minutes, until the temperature becomes stable. (2) Use the Graph of Figure 503 to get the load value related to the temperature, and check the tension value of the Aileron Control Cable. NOTE: The tolerance for the tension of the aileron control cables is ÃÂ± 5 lbf (ÃÂ± 2.3 kgf). (3) If the value of tension of the aileron control cable is out of the tolerance go to SUBTASK 720-028-B step (3) or (4) as applicable. (4) Do steps (1) thru (3) again for the 1/8-inch control cables at the fuselage and wings sector. (5) If both 5/32 and 1/8 control cables are within tolerance, go to Follow-On (SUBTASK 842-016-B) EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 CONFIG-1 27-11-01 Page 4 of 19 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Refer to Figure 503. (b) Apply tension to the 1/8-inch control cables in the fuselage and wings, as follows: 1 Install the GSE 380 (Figure 506) on the 1/8-inch control cable. 2 Apply to the new aileron 1/8-inch control cable circuit a load 50% higher than the load related to the measured temperature, refer to Figure 503. (c) Remove the rig pins (GSE 058) from the control yoke, aileron torque tube, aileron fuselage sector and aileron wing sector. Refer to Figure 501. (d) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH AILERON−CONTROL STAINLESS−STEEL CABLES) Do ten (10) full aileron command cycles (fully left - neutral - fully right - neutral - for each cycle). NOTE: You can operate the aileron system in two modes: mechanical reversion or hydraulic power. Use the mode which is easier for you. (e) (ON AIRCRAFT WITH AILERON−CONTROL CARBON−STEEL CABLES) Do twenty (20) full aileron command cycles (fully left - neutral - fully right - neutral - for each cycle). NOTE: You must operate the aileron system in the mechanical reversion mode. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 CONFIG-1 27-11-01 Page 5 of 19 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (e) With the aid of GSE 380 (Figure 506), adjust the load of the autopilot-servo control cables to the value related to the measured temperature in step 2. (f) When you get the tension value according to the Graph Figure 506, install new locking clips on the turnbuckle. NOTE: If necessary, use an inspection mirror to help you see the alignment between barrel and rod end. (g) If you do not get the specified value, do steps (a) thru (g) again until you have the tension specified: K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-017-B (1) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is a part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations (Section 6) of the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRB).
