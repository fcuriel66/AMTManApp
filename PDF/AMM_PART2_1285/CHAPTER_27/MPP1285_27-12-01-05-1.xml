			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (b) Do steps 3 and on, if one or the two of the compensator level indicators are red, silver or gold (this indicates a depressurized compensator). (3) Do a check of the compensator of PCA system 1 and/or system 2 as applicable: (a) Make sure that aileron systems 1 and 2 are not pressurized. (b) Remove the end cap from the system which contains the depressurized compensator. WARNING: USE EYE PROTECTION WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL LOCKWIRE OR SAFETY CABLE. IF YOU DO NOT USE EYE PROTECTION, CUT PIECES OF WIRE CAN HIT YOUR EYES AND CAUSE INJURY. CAUTION: DO NOT LET PIECES OF DISCARDED LOCK WIRE STAY IN THE WORK AREA. IF NECESSARY, USE A VACUUM CLEANER TO REMOVE THEM. 1 Remove the lockwire. NOTE: • Cut off only the lockwire that attaches the end cap to its nut. • Remove the end cap to reduce the pre-load spring on the check valve and allow the check valve to open further during the aileron actuator cycling. • Pump the piston of the leak detection valve a minimum of five times to dislodge any foreign material. (c) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (d) On the overhead panel, push pushbutton AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 or 2 as applicable to turn on aileron system 1 or 2, respectively. • Make sure that the pushbutton lights go off. (e) Do five full aileron command cycles (fully left - neutral - fully right - neutral - for each cycle) with the aileron system energized. (f) On the overhead panel, push pushbutton AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 or 2 to turn off aileron system 1 or 2, respectively. (g) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200). (h) Place the end cap on the PCA (Figure 505). 1 Clean end caps with isopropyl alcohol. 2 Install the end caps to the PCA. Use GSE 270 for this. 3 Apply torque and safety them.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (j) On the overhead panel, push pushbutton AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 or 2 to turn on aileron system 1 or 2, respectively. (k) Do five full aileron command cycles (fully left - neutral - fully right - neutral - for each cycle) to charge the compensator. (l) Do a check on the compensator to make sure that it is fully charged (the end of the indicator shows green in the sight window). (m) On the overhead panel, push pushbutton AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 or 2 to turn off aileron system 1 or 2, respectively. (n) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200). (o) Do five full aileron command cycles (fully left - neutral - fully right - neutral - for each cycle) with the mechanical reversion mode. (p) During two hours, do a check on the compensator level indicator to make sure that it is green. If the indicator is red, silver or gold the PCA shall be replaced by a serviceable one ( AMM TASK 27-12-01-000-801-A/400). NOTE: Make sure that hydraulic systems 1 and 2 were not pressurized during the last two hours. (4) Do the inspection on the compensator level indicator of systems 1 and 2, in the PCAs of the left and right ailerons. (5) Do a check for excess internal leakage in the Aileron PCA of the left aileron. NOTE: • If problems occur during this step, the PCA is defective. Replace it with a serviceable one ( AMM TASK 27-12-01-000-801-A/400). • Make sure that the spring actuates the piston of the leak detection valve. • If necessary, pull the piston down. If the piston does not go down, replace the PCA with a serviceable one ( AMM TASK 27-12-01-000-801- A/400). WARNING:USE EYE PROTECTION WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL LOCKWIRE OR SAFETY CABLE. IF YOU DO NOT USE EYE PROTECTION, CUT PIECES OF WIRE CAN HIT YOUR EYES AND CAUSE INJURY. CAUTION: DO NOT LET PIECES OF DISCARDED LOCKWIRE STAY IN THE WORK AREA. IF NECESSARY, USE A VACUUM CLEANER TO REMOVE THEM. (a) If applicable, cut the lockwire of the end cap. CAUTION:FOR AIRCRAFT POST-MOD. S.B. 145-27-0062, LOOSEN THE CAP SLOWLY TO PREVENT THE BREAKAGE OF THE STEEL WIRE CORD. (b) Remove the end caps of aileron systems 1 and 2 (Figure 501). • The compensator level indicator must be in colors red, silver or gold.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) Connect GSE 219 to the PCA. Connect it to the multimeter (Figure 501). (d) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (e) On the overhead panel, push pushbutton AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 or 2 as applicable to turn on aileron system 1 or 2, respectively. (f) Use the control yoke to command the aileron up and down quickly. NOTE: If you command the control yoke slowly, the multimeter can incorrectly show that there is electrical continuity (the signal must be closed) while the aileron moves. 1. Make sure that there is no electrical continuity (the signal must be open) while the aileron moves. 2. Stop the aileron command and make sure that there is electrical continuity (the signal must be closed) during 15 seconds minimum, after the command stops. (g) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200). (h) Disconnect the input rod from the PCA (Figure 502). Refer to AMM TASK 27-12-01-000-801-A/400. (i) Disconnect the NRU from the PCA (Figure 503). Refer to AMM TASK 27-11-07-000-801-A/400. (j) Manually move the aileron surface fully up (trailing edge up), until the PCA stops. (k) Put the PCA input lever at the extend command stop. For this, move the input lever totally rearward (Figure 504). WARNING: • MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS IN THE AILERON TRAVEL AREA. • IF THE AILERON MOVES DOWN, LET THE AILERON MOVE FREELY. AFTER THIS, LOOK AT THE PCA INPUT LEVER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS IN THE EXTEND COMMAND STOP (INPUT LEVER IN REARWARD POSITION). (l) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (m) On the overhead panel, push pushbutton AILERON SHUTOFF SYS 1 or 2 as applicable to turn on aileron system 1 or 2, respectively. (n) With the aileron up, make sure that there is electrical continuity (the signal must be closed) during 15 seconds minimum, after the command stops. (o) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200). (p) Manually move the aileron surface fully down (trailing edge down), until the PCA stops.
