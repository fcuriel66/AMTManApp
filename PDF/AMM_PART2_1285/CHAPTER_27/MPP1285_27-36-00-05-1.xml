Operationally Check Stall Protection System (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A WARNING: FOR THIS TEST, THE PUSHER WILL BE OPERATED. MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT NEAR THE ELEVATOR SURFACES. (1) This NOTE refers to the task that follows it: NOTE: When the TEST pushbutton is pushed: 1. Push the TEST pushbutton only until the shakers start. If not, the TEST pushbutton light will not go off at the end of the test and the system will not react to a new test. 2. If the system does not react to a new test, on the overhead circuit breaker panel, open and close the circuit breakers CHANNEL 1 and CHANNEL 2 to reset the Stall Protection System. 3. If the Stall Protection System is reset or the aircraft is energized again, the system must wait for 40 seconds at least, for you to do a new test. (2) On the SPS control panel, make sure that the TEST pushbutton light is on. (3) Do the check as follows: (a) Set the control column to the nose-up position. (b) On the SPS control pane, push the TEST pushbutton until the shakers start. Result: 1 Lightly counteract the tendency of the control column to move forward. 2 Shakers 1 and 2 start. 3 The pusher starts and controls the elevator nose down, and the AURAL clacker sound occurs. 4 On the Glareshield Panel, the master WARNING and the master CAUTION lights flash. (c) Push a master WARNING and a master CAUTION lights. Result: 1 The master WARNING and the master CAUTION lights go off. (d) After approximately 5 seconds, make sure that: Result: 1 Shakers 1 and 2 stop. 2 The pusher and clacker sound stop. 3 The TEST pushbutton light goes off. (4) Do the CUTOUT 1 check as follows: (a) On the SPS control panel, push the CUTOUT 1 pushbutton.
