Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP AND SPOILER TRAVEL AREA. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Energize the aircraft with the External DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (3) Set the flaps to the 45-degree position. CAUTION: TO MOVE THE FLAPS WHEN YOU OPEN THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD, DO AS FOLLOWS (IT WILL PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD AND INBOARD-FLAP LEADING EDGE): • RELEASE THE SPRING FROM THE ROOT AND TIP SUPPORTS OF THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD. • REMOVE THE TIP AND ROOT SUPPORTS ONLY FROM THE INBOARD- FLAP LOWER SHROUD (AMM TASK 57-56-01-000-801-A/400). (4) Open the lower shroud of the inboard flap (AMM TASK 57-56-01-000-801-A/400). (5) Cut and remove the lockwire from the jam nut and the lock washer (Figure 504). WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (6) Set the flaps to the zero-degree position. (7) Make sure that the spoiler panels are closed and the spoiler actuators are fully retracted. (8) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). J. Adjustment of the Spoiler Surface (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Measure the gap between the speed brake trailing edge, and ground spoiler trailing edge to the rubbing strips of the inboard flap. These gaps measurements must be done only on rubbing strips 2 and 4 (Refer to DET. A and DET. B). • The table below shows the three possibles aircraft configuration to do the spoilers adjustment.

(2) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/ 200). (3) If necessary, adjust the spoiler actuator in relation to the surface that is out of specification (Figure 503 and Figure 504): WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (a) Set the flaps to the 45-degree position. (b) Release the jam nut and lock washer (Figure 504). (c) Adjust the rod end of the actuator. Turn the piston hex end to decrease the gap (Figure 504). NOTE: The rod end of the actuator is adjustable at each 60 degrees. WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (d) Set the flaps to the zero-degree position. • WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE SPOILER TRAVEL AREA. • WHEN YOU PRESSURIZE THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM, THE SPOILER PANELS CLOSE. (e) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (4) Do an inspection to make sure that the gap between the panels and the inboard flap is correct, according to the Table 501. (5) If not, do step (3) again, until the gap is adjusted. WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (6) Set the flaps to the 45-degree position. (7) Tighten the jam nut and lock washer against the piston and safety them (Figure 504). (8) Measure the gap from the target to the proximity sensor. See Figure 505. Table 502 GAP = 1.4 ÃÂ± 0.1 mm (9) Measure the gap from the target to the proximity sensor. See Figure 506. Table 503 GAP = 1.8 ÃÂ± 0.1 mm (10) If necessary, adjust the gap of the proximity sensors (Figure 505 and Figure 506). (a) Adjust the gap of 1.4 ÃÂ± 0.1 mm between the target (1) of each panel and the tip of the proximity sensor. See Figure 505. 1 To adjust the gap, replace the target delaminable shim (2). (b) Adjust the gap of 1.8 ÃÂ± 0.1 mm between the target (3) installed in the speed brake and the proximity sensor (4) installed in the wing trailing edge. See Figure 506. NOTE: This proximity sensor is installed in the left wing only. 1 To adjust the gap, adjust the proximity sensor support by loosing the bolt (1) and moving the bracket (3). (c) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200). NOTE: After the adjustment, the disagreement between the inboard and outboard spoiler surfaces is normal. K.
