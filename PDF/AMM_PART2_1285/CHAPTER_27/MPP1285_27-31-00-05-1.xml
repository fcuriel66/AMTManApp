(b) The backlash of the left servo tab is the average value of the backlash of the two cycles. NOTE: • The kinematics of the servo tab mechanism causes the direction of the displacement measured on the dial indicator to be opposite to the direction of application of the loads. Because of this, the Load x Displacement graph made for the servo tab is not equivalent to the Elevator and Spring tab graphs. • You must make sure of a good quality of the readings when you make the graphs. Ignore the points that are too far from the straight lines. If there is too much dispersion of points around the straight line, you must do the test again.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (6) Install rig pins to the forward elevator torque tube (Figure 512). (7) Install rig pins to the left and right control columns (Figure 512). (a) If it is impossible to install the rig pins to the control columns, adjust the rods that connect the elevator bellcrank, at the forward torque tube, to the control columns. 1 Disconnect the left and right rod ends (2) from the end of the elevator control columns (1). Remove the cotters pins (4), nuts (5), washers (6), (8), (9) and (11), bushing (7), bonding straps (10) and bolts (12). 2 Cut and remove the rear and/or forward lockwires (3) from the rods (2) (Figure 514). 3 Install the rig pin to the control columns (Figure 512). 4 Adjust the rods (2) for a correct fitting. 5 Install new lockwires (3) to the rods (2). 6 Connect the left and right rod ends (2) to the end of the elevator control columns (1). Install the bolts (12), bonding straps (10), bushing (7), washers (6), (8), (9) and (11), nuts (5) and cotter pins (4). (8) Put GSE 070 to the left (right) control column and set it to zero (Figure 515). (9) Remove the rig pins from the control column and the forward elevator torque tube. (10) Control the pilot control column fully forward as far as the elevator secondary backstop and fully rearward as far as the elevator secondary backstop. NOTE: To get to the secondary backstops, the control column must be controlled to a position beyond the primary stops. Use some force for this. • Then, measure the control column deflection. The values got must be: Table 508 - DEFLECTION OF THE CONTROL COLUMN  PRE-MOD SB145-27-0050 POST-MOD SB145-27-0050 CONTROL COLUMN [1] [1] 15.0 degrees ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees 19.0 degrees ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees NOSE-UP POSITION CONTROL COLUMN [1] [1] 9.0 degrees ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees 8.5 degrees ÃÂ± 0.5 degrees NOSE-DOWN POSITION [1] Applicable only to elevator deflection for the secondary backstop. (11) Do step 10 again for the copilot control column. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Safety the secondary backstops. (2) Remove the rig pins. (3) Install the pilot and copilot seats (AMM TASK 25-11-01-400-801-A/400). (4) Close all access panels.
