			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 2 The EICAS display does not show failure messages. (d) Release the pressure from the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801- A/200) and install GSE 066 to the ground spoiler actuator and GSE 067 to the speed brake actuator to keep them open (Figure 505). (e) Disconnect connector P1191 from the Ground Spoiler Valve and connector P1169 from the Speed Brake Valve. (f) Keep the ground spoiler panels open. (g) Put the metallic target, one at a time, on the four proximity sensors of the spoilers. See Figure 504. Result: 1 The SPOILER FAIL caution message is shown on the EICAS display, when the metallic target is near each proximity sensor. The SPOILER FAIL caution message goes out of view when the metallic target is away from the proximity sensor. (h) On the Maintenance Panel, release the SPOILER switch. (i) Put the metallic target on the four proximity sensors of the spoilers. Result: 1 On the EICAS there is an indication of the spoiler panels closed. (j) Remove, one at a time, the metallic target from each proximity sensor. Result: 1 On the EICAS, the SPOILER FAIL caution message comes on, when the metallic target is away from the proximity sensor. (k) Put the metallic target on the proximity sensor again, one at a time. Result: 1 On the EICAS, the SPOILER FAIL caution message goes out of view, when the metallic targets are near the four proximity sensors. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the metallic target from the proximity sensors. (2) Connect connector P1191 to the ground spoiler valve and connector P1169 to the speed brake valve. (3) Remove GSE 066 from the ground spoiler actuator and GSE 067 from the speed brake actuator to release them. (4) Make sure that the hydraulic reservoir is full ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-801-A/300). If necessary, fill the reservoirs ( AMM TASK 12-13-01-600-802-A/300). (5) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is a part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations (Section 6) of the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRB).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Cockpit 2 Do the task Outside the aircraft I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Energize the aircraft with an external DC power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Set the flaps to the 45-degree position. (4) Do not do other tasks on the speed brake, ground spoiler, and flap system at this time. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, open the Flap 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT-CLOSE tag to them. CAUTION:WHEN YOU OPEN THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD, IF IT IS NECESSARY TO MOVE THE FLAPS, DO AS FOLLOWS (IT WILL PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD AND INBOARD-FLAP LEADING EDGE): • RELEASE THE SPRINGS FROM THE ROOT AND TIP SUPPORTS OF THE INBOARD-FLAP LOWER SHROUD. (6) Open the lower shroud of the inboard and outboard flaps (AMM TASK 57-56-01-000-801-A/400). J. Functional Check for External Leakage at the Spoiler Actuators (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 720-003-A WARNING:THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM CONTAINS PHOSPHATE-ESTER HYDRAULIC FLUID. THE FLUID CAN CAUSE IRRITATION IN YOUR SKIN OR INJURY TO YOUR EYES. USE THE APPLICABLE RUBBER GOGGLES AND GLOVES. IF THE FLUID TOUCHES YOU, FLUSH YOUR SKIN WITH WATER. IF IT GETS IN YOUR EYES, FLUSH THEM WITH WATER AND GET MEDICAL HELP. (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the SPEED BRAKE and GND SPLR OUTBD circuit breakers. (2) Do steps (1) and (2) of AMM TASK 27-62-01-000-801-A/400 to disconnect the left and right ground spoiler actuators from the spoiler surface and its support. NOTE: With adhesive tape, attach the open surface. (3) Do steps (1) and (2) of AMM TASK 27-62-02-000-801-A/400 to disconnect the left and right speed brake actuators from the spoiler surface and its support. NOTE: With adhesive tape, attach the open surface. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-802-A/500 27-62-00 Page 22 of 25 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Carefully turn the two ground spoiler actuators in the horizontal position and hold them tight. (5) Pressurize hydraulic system 1 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (6) Cycle the actuator until the first drop falls from the unit or until 100 cycles are completed. NOTE: Pay attention to do the steps below because these events cannot occur at the same time on the left and right sides of the aircraft. It is very important to do this leakage test during the same cycling for these two actuators. It is necessary to have two technicians, one for each actuator, to do the steps that follow correctly. (a) If no drop falls until 100 cycles are completed, stop the cycling. The actuator is in good condition. NOTE: The actuator can leak from its rod end and from its body seal. (b) If one drop falls from the unit before the 100 cycles are completed, go to step (7). NOTE: Do not clean the actuator because the hydraulic fluid on the actuator body will permit you to count the drops. (7) Do 25 cycles again and look to see if more than two drops fall from the unit. If it occurs, replace the actuator. (8) Release the pressure from hydraulic system 1 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (9) On the circuit breaker panel, open the GND SPLR INBD circuit breaker and close the SPEED BRAKE and GND SPLR OUTBD circuit breakers. (10) Carefully turn the two speed brake actuators in the horizontal direction and hold them tight. NOTE: It is necessary to wait until the actuator gets the fully extended position to cycle it again. (11) Pressurize hydraulic system 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (12) Do steps (6) and (7) again. (13) Release the pressure from hydraulic system 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (14) Do steps (1) and (2) of AMM TASK 27-62-01-400-801-A/400 to install the left and right ground spoiler actuators to the spoiler surface and its support. (15) Do steps (1) and (2) of AMM TASK 27-62-02-400-801-A/400 to install the left and right speed brake actuators to the spoiler surface and its support. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Close the lower shroud of the inboard flap (AMM TASK 57-56-01-400-801-A/400).
