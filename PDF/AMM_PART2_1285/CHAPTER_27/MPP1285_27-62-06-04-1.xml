Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Put the speed brake panel (1) on the wing structure. (2) Install the bolts, bushing, washers (2 positions), nuts, and cotter pins (2), (5), and (8) to connect the hinges of the speed brake panel (1) to the supports (3), (7), and (9) at the wing structure (3 positions). (3) Put the end of the actuator (4) in the support at the speed brake panel (1) and attach it with the bolt, two washers, bushing, nut, and cotter pin (10). NOTE: Refer to AMM TASK 27-62-02-400-801-A/400 for the correct installation of the actuator (4). (4) Connect the bonding strap (6) to the support (7) at the wing structure with the bolt, three washers, and nut (11). NOTE: Refer to AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200 for the correct installation of the bonding strap (6). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the GND SPLR OUTBD circuit breaker and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (2) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them. (3) Close the lower shroud of the inboard flap (AMM TASK 57-56-01-400-801-A/400).
