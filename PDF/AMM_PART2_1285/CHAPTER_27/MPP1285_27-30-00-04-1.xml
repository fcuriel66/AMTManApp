			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL ELEVATOR AND TAB - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. This section gives the procedures to remove and install the elevators. B. These procedures are applicable to the LH and RH elevators. C. On aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-27-0075, before you replace the elevator from different aircraft, you must do as follows: • On aircraft PRE-MOD. S.B.145-55-0020, elevators are interchangeable. • On aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-55-0020, make sure that the flight data recorder supports are installed on the elevators. Refer to AMM TASK 31-31-06-400-804-A/400. D. On aircraft POST-MOD. S.B.145-27-0075, before you replace the elevator from different aircraft, you must do as follows: • Make sure that the aircraft is POST-MOD. S.B.145-55-0020 and the flight data recorder supports are installed on the elevators. Refer to AMM TASK 31-31-06-400-804-A/400. E. If it is necessary to remove/install the elevator surface because of the removal of the horizontal stabilizer ( AMM TASK 55-10-00-000-801-A/400), you must do as follows: • If you replaced the horizontal stabilizer with a new one or if you replaced it with an horizontal stabilizer used on other aircraft, do a calibration of the elevator with the control-column position transducer ( AMM TASK 27-30-00-700-801-A/500). • If you installed the same horizontal stabilizer on the same aircraft, do not do the calibration of the elevator with the control-column position transducer ( AMM TASK 27-30-00-700-801- A/500). F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

Refer to DET. B, (Figure 401) or (Figure 402). (7) Install cotter pins to the bolts (14) (2 positions) and (10). Refer to , DET. E and DET. C, (Figure 401) or (Figure 402). (8) Put the end of the rod (13) in the support (11) at the stabilizer structure and attach it with the bolt, washers, bushing, nut, and cotter pin (12). Refer to , DET. D, (Figure 401) or (Figure 402). (9) Do the check of the rod (2) that connects the elevator to the rear quadrant and adjust it if necessary ( AMM TASK 27-31-00-700-804-A/500). (10) Put the end of the rod (2) in the bellcrank (3) of the elevator (1) and attach it with the bolt, washer, bushing, nut, and cotter pin (7). Refer to DET. B, (Figure 401) or (Figure 402). (11) Connect the bonding strap (6) to the bellcrank (3) of the elevator (1) with the bolt, washers and nut (5). Refer to DET. B, (Figure 401) or (Figure 402). NOTE: Refer to AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200 for the correct installation of the bonding strap (6). (12) Connect the bonding straps (15) (2 positions) and (8) to the supports (16) (2 positions) and (9) at the stabilizer structure with the bolt, washers and nut (17). Refer to DET. F, (Figure 401) or (Figure 402). NOTE: Refer to AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200 for the correct installation of the bonding straps (15) and (8). (13) Remove the rig pin from the rear sector. (14) (For aircraft with RVDTS/RVITS and mechanical gust lock without provisions for electromechanical gust lock) Reconnect the RVDTS/RVITS electrical connector and install the washer (4) and nut (3) to connect the rod to the elevator surface. Refer to (Figure 407). (15) (For aircraft with RVDTS/RVITS and electromechanical gust lock or with provisions for it PRE-MOD. S.B.145-31-0045) Reconnect the RVDTS/RVITS electrical connector and EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 27-30-00 Page 16 of 17 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL install the bolt (2), washer (3) and nut (4), and then, carefully reconnect the elevator FDR adapter to the stabilizer structure. Refer to (Figure 408). (16) (For aircraft with RVDTS/RVITS and electromechanical gust lock or with provisions for it POST-MOD. S.B.145-31-0045) Install the bolt (2), washer (3), RVDT/RVIT harness support (5), and nut (4), to reconnect the elevator FDR adapter to the stabilizer structure and install the RVDTS/RVITS ( AMM TASK 31-31-06-400-802-A/400). Refer to (Figure 408). K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Adjust the spring-tab ( AMM TASK 27-31-08-700-801-A/500). (2) Do the elevator deflection test ( AMM TASK 27-31-00-700-803-A/500). (3) Do the servo-tab deflection test (AMM TASK 27-31-04-700-802-A/500). NOTE: Do this step only if you replaced the elevator with a new one or if you replaced it with an elevator used on other aircraft, or if you changed the shims of the servo-tab support. (4) Do the RVDTS/RVITS calibration procedure ( AMM TASK 31-31-06-820-802-A/500). (5) Do a check of the elevator primary mechanical control backlash (AMM TASK 27-31-00-700-801-A/500). NOTE: Do this step only if you replaced the elevator with a new one, if you replaced it with an elevator used on other aircraft or if you replace any bearings elevator torsion bar, refer to (AMM TASK 55-20-02-000-802-A/400). (6) Install access panels 335CB, 335DB, 335EB, 335FB, 335GB, and 335HB or 336CB, 336DB, 336EB, 336FB, 336GB and 336HB (AMM MPP 06-42-00/100). (7) Install front fairings 321 of the vertical stabilizer ( AMM TASK 55-36-00-400-801-A/ 400). (8) Do the elevator calibration with the control-column position transducers ( AMM TASK 27-30-00-700-801-A/500). NOTE: Do this step only If you replaced the elevator and/or the horizontal stabilizer with a new one or if you replaced them with an elevator and/or an horizontal stabilizer used on other aircraft EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 27-30-00 Page 17 of 17 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
