(4) Turn off the Electric Motor-Driver Pumps 1 and 2 (EMDP 1 and 2) ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-802-A/200). (5) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the ADC 1, RUDDER 1, and RUDDER 2 circuit breakers. (6) Make sure that the YAW TRIM circuit breaker is closed on the Circuit Breaker Panel. (7) Make sure that the YAW TRIM indication is in the neutral position, on the EICAS. (8) Install GSE 075. See Figure 502. (9) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the STEER circuit breaker and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to it. (10) On GSE 075, operate the LED test switch to do a test of the LEDs. (11) Do these procedures as specified in the table of Figure 503. NOTE: • The table of Figure 503 shows the actions related to these columns:  STEP, N2 SIGNAL CBs, PEDALS, RUDDER SHUTOFF, and SWITCHES. • The table of Figure 503 shows the results related to these columns:  LEDs on/off, EICAS. • When you do steps 1 thru 48 of the table of Figure 503, you must change the actions to get the results specified in the table of Figure 503. • In the “pedals” column: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-25-00 Page 6 of 13 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL  - Where there is an asterisk (*), move the rudder pedal against the stop and use force to operate the spring-loaded cartridge.  - Where there is no asterisk, only keep the rudder pedals against the stop but do not use force for the spring-loaded cartridge operation. Do not remove your foot from the rudder pedal.  - The (1P) symbol stands for pilot, the (2P) symbol stands for copilot, and the (X) stands for pilot and copilot. • On the “EICAS” message column:  M1 is RUDDER SYS 1-2 INOP caution message.  M2 is RUD HDOV PROT FAIL caution message.  M3 is RUDDER SYS 2 INOP caution message. • Do steps 1 thru 28 with the hydraulic system depressurized.  For aircraft with the Rudder Movable Primary Stop Mechanism installed, the EICAS display will show the RUD STOP DISAGREE caution message. Ignore this message. • Do steps 29 thru 48 with the hydraulic system pressurized ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). • On the LED column, the black mark means that the LED is on. • On the LED column, the white mark means that the LED is off. • On the LED column, from L1 to L5 and from R1 to R5 relates to LH and RH Rudder Position Microswitches. Refer to CMM 27-25-00. (12) If the information on the GSE 075 is different from the information available on Figure 503, correct the problem as shown in the comments column in the tables of figure 305 of FIM 27-22-00/301. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) On the Flight Control Panel, push the RUDDER SHUTOFF SYS 1 and RUDDER SHUTOFF SYS 2 pushbuttons to turn off rudder systems 1 and 2. (2) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the N2 SIGNAL 1A, N2 SIGNAL 2A, N2 SIGNAL 1B, and N2 SIGNAL 2B circuit breakers. (3) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the STEER circuit breaker and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from it. (4) Release the pressure of the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (5) Remove GSE 075. (6) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 27-25-00 Page 7 of 13 Rev 55 - Oct 29/18 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
