			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (21) If applicable to aircraft configuration, install the nut (56), washer (57) and (60), and bolt (61) to attach the bonding jumper (58). Refer to Figure 401, Sheet 3, DET. J. (22) If applicable to aircraft configuration, apply torque to 2.8 to 3.4 N.m (25 to 30 lb.in) to the bolt (61). Refer to Figure 401, Sheet 3, DET. J. (23) Connect the input rod (6) to the PCA input lever (13). Refer to (Figure 403), DET. C. Use the bolt (15) , washers (11) and (14), bushing (12) and nut (10), but do not apply the torque. NOTE: If the input rod end (6) has a grease nipple, make sure that the rod-end grease nipple is pointed down and there is no interference with the PCA surface (refer to (Figure 403), DET. D). If the grease nipple is pointed up, an interference with the PCA surface can occur. (24) Remove the rig pin from the wing sector of the aileron. (25) Energize the aircraft with the external DC-power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (26) Pressurize the hydraulic system ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (27) Move the left control wheel fully left and fully right and then move it back to the neutral position. Do this cycle 10 times to bleed the PCA. (28) Install the rig pin to the wing sector of the aileron. (29) Do a check of the aileron neutral position. NOTE: The neutral position of the aileron is identified by the alignment of the aileron with the wing trailing edge, at the aileron root. (30) If the misalignment of the aileron and wing trailing edges is more than 2 mm, do the rough adjustment procedure (step 31) before you do the fine adjustment procedure (step 32). For misalignment of less than 2 mm, do the fine adjustment procedure directly (step 32). WARNING:DO NOT DISCONNECT THE INPUT ROD FROM THE PCA WITH HYDRAULIC SYSTEMS 1 OR 2 ON. THE PCA MUST BE WITHOUT HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TO DISCONNECT THE INPUT ROD. (31) If necessary, do this step to do the rough adjustment. Refer to (Figure 403). (a) Turn off hydraulic systems 1 and 2 ( AMM TASK 29-10-00-860-801-A/200). (b) Disconnect the rod end (6) of the input rod (1) from the PCA input lever. WARNING:USE EYE PROTECTION WHEN YOU REMOVE OR INSTALL LOCKWIRE OR SAFETY CABLE. IF YOU DO NOT USE EYE PROTEC- TION, CUT PIECES OF WIRE CAN HIT YOUR EYES AND CAUSE INJURY. CAUTION: DO NOT LET PIECES OF DISCARDED LOCKWIRE STAY IN THE WORK AREA. IF NECESSARY, USE A VACUUM CLEANER TO RE-MOVE THEM.
