NOTE: When you remove these supports and belts, install the bolts that were removed. (b) Install magnetic stand support AGE-00606-401 of the dial indicator (GSE 073) on the left side of the vertical stabilizer. Refer to Figure 501. • Remove the two bolts that attach the boom fairing to the vertical stabilizer. • Use the bolts of GSE to install the magnetic stand support of the dial indicator. NOTE: When you remove this support, you must install the bolts that were removed. (c) Install the magnetic stand (GSE 072) to support AGE-00606-401. (d) Install the dial indicator on the magnetic stand. (e) The dial indicator stylus must touch the lower skin of the horizontal stabilizer near the boom fairing.

S.B. 145-31-0033 and equipped with HSCU 1009 or 5009, after seven seconds, on the EICAS, the message PTRIM BKP SW FAIL comes on, and the TRIM aural message stops. NOTE: If the conditions of results 2 and 3 are not applicable, no aural message is heard and no visual message is displayed on the EICAS. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) On the Circuit Breaker Panel open the PTRIM 1 and PTRIM 2 circuit breakers and close them to reset the EICAS messages. (2) Set the horizontal stabilizer to the neutral position. (3) De-energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).

General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the operational check of the “Takeoff Trim” aural warning. (2) Because of the tolerance of EICAS and AWS, when the pitch trim is adjusted on the threshold of green band (Figure 508), there will probably be a disagreement between NO TAKEOFF CONFIG message, on the EICAS, and "Takeoff Trim" aural warning.
