			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Operationally Check Flap Fail Message (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-012-B (1) Do a check of the FLAP FAIL caution message and FLAP LOW SPEED advisory message. (a) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1 circuit breaker. Result: 1 The EICAS display shows the FLAP LOW SPEED advisory message. (b) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 2 circuit breaker. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the FLAP LOW SPEED advisory message goes out of view. 2 The EICAS display shows the FLAP FAIL caution message. (c) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the FLAP FAIL caution message goes out of view. (2) Do a check of the continuous flap-position indication on the EICAS. (a) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open the FLAP 1 circuit breaker. Result: 1 On the EICAS display shows the FLAP LOW SPEED advisory message. (b) If the flap position indication on EICAS is an amber dash (-), do as follows: 1. Set the back-up battery switch to OFF. 2. Open the IC1 circuit breaker and wait until the red cross shows on EICAS display. 3. Close the IC1 circuit breaker. (c) Set the flaps to the 9-degree position. Result: 1 The EICAS shows the continuous flap-position indication from 0 degrees to 9 degrees. (d) Set the flaps to the 0-degree position. (e) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, close the FLAP 1 circuit breaker. Result: 1 On the EICAS display, the FLAP LOW SPEED advisory message goes out of view. (f) If the FLAP LOW SPEED advisory message does not go out of view, do the flap reset as follows: 1. On the Maintenance Panel, actuate the FLAP RESET switch and keep it pushed. 2. On the Circuit Breaker Panel, open and close the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers to clear the fault.
