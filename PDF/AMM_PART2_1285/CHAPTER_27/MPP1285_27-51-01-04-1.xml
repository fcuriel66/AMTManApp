Installation (Figure 401) (Figure 402)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS OR EQUIPMENT IN THE FLAP TRAVEL AREA. (1) Put the flap transmission brake (1) on the rib of the center track. (2) Tighten the bolts (3), washers (2), and nuts (8) to install the flap transmission brake (1). (3) Install the FTB test fixture (GSE 071 or click-type torque wrench, as recommend) on the flap transmission brake (1). (4) Apply a torque of 7 N.m (62 lbf.in) to the FTB in the two directions. Make sure that no angular movement occurs. NOTE: • It is recommended to utilize a click-type torque wrench to avoid a false indications or occurrences and minimize human factor during the functional check. • The investigation determined that using a dial-type torque wrench it is possible to apply a quick impulse to achieve the desired setting along with inadvertently exceeding the holding ability of the FTB. • When you start to apply the torque, a small angular movement occurs because of the FTB backlash. Other angular movements are not allowed. (5) Electrically release the FTB. NOTE: To turn the FTB hex shaft you must use GSE 065 or the adapter connector (Figure 402) to electrically release the FTB. (a) If you use GSE 065 to release the FTB, do the procedures that follow: 1. Connect GSE 065 to the FTB connector. 2. Connect the external DC-power rectifier (GSE 051) to the GSE 065.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 3. Energize the FTB with the external DC-power rectifier (GSE 051). (b) If you use the adapter connector, do the procedures that follow: 1. Disconnect electrical connector P1104 from the flap electronic control unit (FECU). 2. Connect the adapter connector (Figure 402) to connector P1104. 3. Energize the aircraft with the external power supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). 4. On the circuit breaker panel, make sure that the FLAP 1 and FLAP 2 circuit breakers are closed. (6) Apply torque to the FTB in the two directions. Make sure that no sticking of brake occurs. NOTE: A brake-out torque not larger than 0.5 N.m (4.42 lbf.in) is permitted. (7) Remove the FTB test fixture (GSE 071 or click-type torque wrench, as recommend) of the flap transmission brake (1). (8) Align the male hex shaft of the flap transmission brake (1) with the female hex shaft of section 4 and section 5 of the FFSs. (9) If you used GSE 065, do the procedure that follows: (a) De-energize the FTB. (b) Disconnect the external DC-power rectifier (GSE 051) from the GSE 065. (c) Disconnect GSE 065 from the FTB connector. (10) If you used the adapter connector, do the procedure that follows: (a) De-energize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (b) Disconnect the adapter connector (Figure 402) from connector P1104. (c) Connect electrical connector P1104 to the FECU. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO GREASE IN THE CAVITIES OF THE FFS AND FTB. GREASE CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE FTB. (11) Clean the cavities of the FTB and FFS to remove all possible signs of grease. (12) Before you install FFS section 4 (4) and FFS section 5 (7), replace the O-ring (9). Refer to (Figure 401) (13) Coat the new O-ring (9) with a thin film of Parker Super-O-Lube before the assembly. (14) Connect FFS section 4 (4) and FFS section 5 (7) to the FTB. (15) Apply a torque of 19.2 to 25 N.m (170 to 221 lb.in) to the FFS section 4 (4) and FFS section 5 (7).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (16) Safety the FFS section 4 (4) and FFS section 5 (7). NOTE: Make sure that the shaft is inserted fully, before you lockwire the nut. WARNING: DO NOT GET LEKTRO-TECH SUPER CORR-B-12350 LUBRICANT AND ANTICORROSIVE FILM IN YOUR MOUTH OR EYES, OR ON YOUR SKIN. PUT ON A PROTECTIVE SPLASH GOGGLE AND GLOVES WHEN YOU USE IT. KEEP AWAY FROM SPARKS, FLAME, AND HEAT. LEKTRO-TECH SUPER CORR-B-12350 LUBRICANT AND ANTICORROSIVE FILM IS A POISONOUS AND FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE. (17) Apply Lektro-Tech Super Corr-B-12350 film to the plug connector to prevent corrosion and clean the contacts. Refer to (Figure 401). NOTE: There is not a definition for the exact amount of spray to be applied, but the product must cover the contacts without excess spray. Excess spray does not cause damage to the connector contacts and/or rubber, but can contribute to dirt accumulation. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE PLUG FULLY COVERS THE RED BAND ON THE RECEPTACLE BODY. (18) Connect the electrical connector (5) (Figure 401). NOTE: It is recommended that soft jaw pliers (GSE 299) be used to make sure that the connector is connected correctly.
