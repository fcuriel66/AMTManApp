(2) Open the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-000-801-A/400) to get access to the starter control valve. (3) Remove the starter control-valve filter ( AMM TASK 80-10-02-000-802-A/400). J. Clean Start Control-Valve Filter SUBTASK 160-002-A (1) Do the procedure below to remove the grease and carbon from the filter: (2) Flush the filter element internally and externally with clean water at a high pressure. (3) Put the filter element in a beaker with the open end of the filter down and fill the beaker with an electrocleaner solution. (4) Put the beaker, with the filter element, in an ultrasonic cleaner tank. Fill the tank with water until the water level is 3/8 in (1 cm) from top of the beaker. (5) Operate the ultrasonic cleaner tank for five minutes. Remove the filter element and discard the dirty electrocleaner solution. Flush the filter element and the beaker with clean electrocleaner solution with the use of a plastic squeeze bottle. (6) Repeat the procedures given in steps (3) to (5), as many times as necessary, until the electrocleaner solution remains clean after five minutes of operation of the ultrasonic cleaner tank. WARNING: WEAR PROTECTIVE GLASSES WHEN YOU USE THE COMPRESSED AIR SOURCE TO DRY THE FILTER ELEMENT. IF ANY LOOSE PARTICLES GET INTO YOUR EYES, INJURIES CAN HAPPEN. (7) Remove the filter element from the beaker and flush internally and externally with clean water at a high pressure. Dry the filter element with compressed air. (8) If the procedures above are not effective, proceed as follows: (9) Put the filter element in an electrocleaner solution for four to six minutes. During this time, make the filter element an anode for one or two minutes at 4 to 7 V DC. Flush the filter element in water.
