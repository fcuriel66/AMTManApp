			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: • BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 71-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL. • HOLD THE ATS CORRECTLY BEFORE YOU REMOVE IT FROM THE GEARBOX. THE ATS WEIGHTS ABOUT 9.0 KILOGRAMS (20 POUNDS). CAUTION: • BEFORE YOU INSTALL AN ATS THAT WAS STORED DURING ONE YEAR OR MORE, MAKE SURE THAT THE STORAGE INSTRUCTIONS PROCEDURE OF HONEYWELL CMM 80-12-13 WAS DONE. • DO NOT PUT THE WEIGHT OF THE ATS ON THE ATS OUTPUT SHAFT. DAMAGE TO THE SPLINES CAN OCCUR IF THE INSTALLATION IS NOT CAREFUL. • MAKE SURE THAT THE BOLTS OF THE V-CLAMPS ARE NOT INSTALLED VERTICALLY TO PREVENT CHAFING, WHICH COULD CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE LOWER ENGINE COWLING. • DO THE ATS OIL LEVEL CHECK AND FILL THE ATS ONLY AFTER THE ATS IS INSTALLED TO PREVENT INCORRECT QUANTITIES. (1) Remove the protection pads from the ATS port, in the engine accessory gear-box, if applicable. (2) Remove the protection caps from the ATS air inlet and from the air supply duct, if applicable. (3) Lubricate the new O-rings (2) and (3) with oil (engine oil) and install them on the ATS drive shaft and pilot diameter of the ATS. NOTE: Make sure that the O-ring on the ATS drive shaft is in correct groove, not in the spline relief groove. (4) Install the ATS (4) on the engine gear-box. Make sure that the splines of the shaft engage the drive gear of the accessory gear-box. (5) Turn the ATS (4) counterclockwise and lock the keyway slot on the shoulder bolt. (6) Put the V-clamp (1) on the ATS and on the engine gear-box adapter flange and torque the V-clamp (1). Refer to Figure 401. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE ENDS OF THE CLAMP DO NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER WHEN THE CORRECT ATTACHMENT TORQUE IS APPLIED. (7) Install the V-clamp (5) to attach the duct (6) to the ATS and torque the clamp (5). Refer to Figure 401. (8) Fill the ATS with the approved oil (AMM TASK 80-10-01-600-801-A/300).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Remove the workstand from the work area. (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them: • START 1/2. (4) Do the test that follows: (a) If you remove/install the ATS of both engines during the time the aircraft is stopped for maintenance until next flight, do the engine leak test for each engine (run at max. takeoff power for at least 3 minutes, but not for more than 5 minutes). Refer to the latest revision of Rolls-Royce (MM CSP 34022). (b) If you remove/install the ATS of one engine only during the time the aircraft is stopped until next flight, do an ATS leak test (dry motor the engine). Refer to AMM TASK 71-00-01-910-803-A/200.
