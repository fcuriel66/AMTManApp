			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Remove the protection caps from the disconnected points, if applicable. CAUTION: • THE INCORRECT ALIGNMENT OF THE DUCTS WILL MAKE IT NECESSARY TO APPLY TOO MUCH TORQUE AND CAUSE AN UNWANTED PRELOAD. • WHILE YOU TIGHTEN THE V-BAND CLAMP, HAVE THE DUCT WEIGHTS MANUALLY HELD. (2) Put the ducts (4) in position and connect their ends. CAUTION:MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A MINIMUM GAP OF 0.1 in (2.54 mm) BETWEEN THE V-BAND CLAMP (8) AND THE AIR COOLED OIL COOLER LINE, TO PREVENT A POSSIBLE CHAFING WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN OIL LEAKAGE. (3) Install the V-band clamps (2), (3), (5), (6), and (8) to attach the ATS ducts (4). Tighten the clamps to the torque shown in Figure 401. NOTE: To get the minimum gap of 0.1 in (2.54 mm), if necessary, loosen the clamps and/or the support bolts of the ATS duct. Then adjust the gap and tighten the assembly again. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE BOLT OF THE CLAMP (2) IS INSTALLED IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION TO PREVENT CHAFING, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DAMAGE TO THE LOWER ENGINE COWLING. (4) Install the clamps (1) and (7) to attach the ducts to the engine supports. Tighten the clamps to the torque shown in Figure 401 to the clamps. J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Remove the ladder.
