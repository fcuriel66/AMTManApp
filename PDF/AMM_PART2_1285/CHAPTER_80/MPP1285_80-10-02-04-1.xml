			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: • BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 71-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. • INJURY TO PERSONS CAN OCCUR IF THE REMAINING PRESSURE IN THE DUCT IS NOT RELEASED BEFORE THE STARTER CONTROL VALVE IS REMOVED. (1) Remove the caps from the ports of the starter air ducts. (2) Remove the protection caps from the electrical connectors. CAUTION: • THE INCORRECT ALIGNMENT OF THE DUCTS WILL MAKE IT NECESSARY TO APPLY TOO MUCH TORQUE AND CAUSE AN UNWANTED PRELOAD. • WHILE YOU TIGHTEN THE V-BAND CLAMP, HAVE THE DUCT WEIGHT MANUALLY HELD. • MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A MINIMUM GAP OF 0.1 in (2.54 mm) BETWEEN THE V-BAND CLAMP (5) AND THE AIR-COOLED OIL COOLER LINE TO PREVENT A POSSIBLE CHAFING AND OIL LEAKAGE. • MAKE SURE THAT THE CLAMP BOLT (9) IS NOT ASSEMBLED VERTICALLY TO PREVENT CHAFING AND POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE LOWER ENGINE COWLING. (3) Put the SCV at the air-duct starter lines and attach it with the V-band clamps (5) and (7). Tighten the clamps to the torque shown in (Figure 401). NOTE: To get the minimum gap of 0.1 in (2.54 mm), if necessary, loosen the clamps and/or the support bolts of the ATS duct. Then adjust the gap and tighten the assembly again. CAUTION: DURING THE LH ENGINE ASSEMBLY, MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A MAXIMUM GAP OF 3.0 mm BETWEEN THE SCV-SERVO BODY ASSEMBLY (9) AND THE ENGINE REAR MOUNTING RING TO PREVENT CHAFING WITH THE LOWER ENGINE COWLING. (4) Install the bolt (2), washers (3), and nut (4). Tighten the bolts to the torque shown in (Figure 401). (5) If necessary, loosen the V-band clamps (10), (11), and (12), and the clamps (13). (6) Tighten the V-band clamps (5) and (7) to the torque shown in (Figure 401). (7) Connect the electrical connectors (6) and (8) to the SCV.
