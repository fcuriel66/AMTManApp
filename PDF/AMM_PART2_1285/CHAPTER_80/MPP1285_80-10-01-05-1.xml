			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Engine I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 71-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL. (1) On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers below and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • START 1/2. (2) Put the workstand in the work area. (3) Open the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-000-801-A/400) to get access to the ATS. J. Functionally Check the Air Turbine Starter (ATS) and Oil Servicing (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  SUBTASK 720-002-A (1) Drain the oil from the air turbine starter as follows (Figure 501): (a) NOTE: • Have the correct container to collect the oil drained from the ATS. • Use a filter or screen to keep the metal particles that can be in the drained oil. Cut the lockwire and remove the magnetic drain plug assembly (5) from the ATS. Discard the O-ring (4). (b) Let the oil drain fully. (2) Do the check of the ATS oil level. Measure the oil quantity collected in the container. If the quantity of drained oil is less than 140 cc, replace the ATS (AMM MPP 80-10-01/400). (3) Remove the magnetic drain plug (6) from the magnetic drain plug assembly (5) and examine for accumulation of metallic particles. (4) Refer to Figure 502 to determine the level of contamination: (a) If the magnetic plug is clean or has light fuzz, clean it and install it. (b) If moderate fuzz is found, examine the filter or screen as follows: 1 If you find particles with more than 2.54 mm (0.100 in), this shows a gear, bearing or clutch failure. Replace the ATS (AMM MPP 80-10-01/400). 2 If there are no large flakes, chips, slivers or particles, clean and install the magnetic drain plug (6).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (c) If there are metal chips accumulation, large flakes, chips, slivers or particles, replace the ATS (AMM MPP 80-10-01/400). CAUTION: TO PREVENT DAMAGE, FILL THE ATS WITH THE SAME OIL AS THE ONE APPROVED FOR THE ENGINE (SEE AMM MPP 20-30-02/200). • FOR AIRCRAFT WITH STARTER PNEUMATIC UNIT UP TO P/N 3505910-6 INSTALLED, DO NOT USE THE MIL-PRF-23699 HTS OILS. • FOR AIRCRAFT WITH STARTER PNEUMATIC UNIT P/N 3505910-7 INSTALLED, YOU CAN ALSO USE THE MIL-PRF-23699 HTS OILS. (5) NOTE: Do not mix oil the brands and types. Lubricate the O-ring (4) with the oil used in the ATS and install it in the magnetic drain plug assembly (5). (6) Install the magnetic drain plug assembly (5) to the ATS. (7) Torque and safety the magnetic drain plug assembly with lockwire. (8) Cut the lockwire and remove the refilling plug (3) from the ATS. Discard the O-ring (2). (9) Fill the ATS with the approved oil until the oil level comes to the plug housing (1) (an oil overflow must occur). (10) Lubricate the O-ring (2) with the oil used in the ATS and install it in the refilling plug (3). (11) Install the refilling plug (3) to the ATS. (12) Torque and safety the refilling plug with lockwire. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the lower cowling ( AMM TASK 71-12-01-400-801-A/400). (2) Remove the workstand from the work area. (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them: • START 1/2.
