			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) Remove the crew seats (AMM TASK 25-11-01-000-801-A/400). (3) To do the detailed inspection of the crew seats, have a direct source of good lighting to make the lighting conditions in the cockpit better. J. Detailed Inspection of the Cockpit Seats for Security of Attachment to the Track, Including Restraint System (Figure 601)  SUBTASK 220-002-A (1) Do a detailed inspection of the pilot and copilot seat tracks for wear as follows: NOTE: These steps are applicable to each seat track of the pilot and copilot seat. (a) Examine each seat track of the pilot and copilot seat for general conditions and degradation, cracks, damage, and wear that can you see easily. (b) Use the damage limits SRM 53-12-11/101 to examine each seat track. (c) If the wear in a seat track is larger than the damage limits specified in SRM 53-12-11/101, replace it ( AMM TASK 53-01-05-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 53-01-05-400-801-A/400) and go to step 2 to do a detailed inspection on the pilot and copilot seats. (d) If the wear in each seat track is smaller than the damage limits specified in SRM 53-12-11/101, go to step 2 to do a detailed inspection on the pilot and copilot seats. NOTE: To go to step 2, make sure that the wear in all seat tracks are smaller than the damage limits specified in SRM 53-12-11/101. (2) Do a detailed inspection on the pilot and copilot seats to make sure that their locking pins lock in the tracks as follows: NOTE: The steps are applicable to each hole of the seat tracks where the locking pins of the pilot and copilot seat are attached. (a) Clean the cockpit seat tracks ( AMM TASK 53-01-05-100-801-A/700). (b) Install the pilot or copilot seat (AMM TASK 25-21-01-400-801-A/400). (c) Sit down in the installed seat (pilot or copilot seat). (d) With the rail locking control, move the crew seat forward, stopping at each positioning hole to make sure that the locking pins engage at each hole of the seat track. NOTE: Make sure that the crew seat locks in each hole of the track. (e) With the rail locking control, move the crew seat rearwards, stopping at each positioning hole to make sure that the locking pins engage at each hole of the seat track.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Make sure that the crew seat locks in each hole of the track. (f) Do steps (d) and (e) two or three times to make sure that the locking pins of the crew seat lock in each hole of the seat tracks. (g) If you find an irregular condition, examine the diameter of each hole of the seat tracks as follows: NOTE: If necessary, remove the crew seat (AMM TASK 25-11-01-000-801-A/ 400). 1 If the diameter of the hole is smaller than 8.3 mm (0.327 in), increase it to 8.3 mm (0.327 in) to permit a correct locking of the locking pins of the crew seat in their tracks and go to step (i). 2 Protect with Alodine the reworked area of the tracks (CPM 51-21-04). 3 If the diameter of the hole is larger than 8.3 mm (0.327 in) and smaller than the damage limits specified in SRM 53-12-11/101, go to step (h). (h) Use the GSE 364 to examine the alignment of the seat tracks as follows (Figure 601): 1 Install GSE 364 (1) to the first locking pin hole (7). 2 Use GSE 364 (1) to make sure that the locking pin engages correctly at each hole. NOTE: If there is interference between locking pin holes and GSE 364 (1) or seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) to GSE 364 (1), remove the GSE 364 (1) and replace the seat track ( AMM TASK 53-01-05-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 53-01-05-400-801-A/ 400). 3 If there is no interference between locking pin holes and GSE 364 (1), transfer GSE 364 (1) to the twelfth locking pin hole. NOTE: If there is interference between locking pin holes and GSE 364 (1) or seat tracks (5) and (6) (LH and RH sides) to GSE 364 (1), remove the GSE 364 (1) and replace the seat track ( AMM TASK 53-01-05-000-801-A/400 and AMM TASK 53-01-05-400-801-A/ 400). (i) If you removed the crew seat, install it again (AMM TASK 25-11-01-400-801-A/ 400). (j) Do steps (c) to (f) to make sure that the locking pins of the crew seat lock in each hole of the seat track. NOTE: Also make sure that the crew seat move correctly and smoothly. (k) Do steps (b) to (j) for the other crew seat. (3) Do the adjustment/test of the inertial seat belts (AMM TASK 25-11-00-700-801-A/500). (4) Do a detailed inspection on the seat belt lock as follows: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 200-801-A/600 25-11-01 Page 4 of 10 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
