			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 25-51-01-300-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT LINING - PATCH REPAIR A. General (1) This task gives the instructions to repair the baggage-compartment lining with patches. NOTE: There are two approved patches for this repair: AKRO Fireguard Speed Patch, AF 800 Series, and Permaglass Cargo Lining Repair Patch, 100 Series. (2) For these patch repairs, no set-up or cure time is necessary. The aircraft can be put back into service immediately. (3) The patch repair method was tested and approved for use on the front side of the panel. (4) The minimum distance between two patch repairs must be 38 millimeters (1.5 inches). (5) The maximum repairable damage is limited by the combination of patch repair with the material of the baggage compartment lining where it will be applied. Refer to table 802 and Figure 801, Figure 802 and Figure 803 for the maximum damage and types of damage that can be repaired in each case.

Patch Repair (Figure 801)  (Figure 802)  (Figure 803)  (Figure 804)  SUBTASK 340-002-A (1) Do these steps for all types of baggage-compartment damaged lining. NOTE: These steps are not applicable when the damage is a scratch. • Remove the baggage-compartment damaged lining ( AMM TASK 25-51-01-000-801-A/400). • Make an inspection on the systems installed in the area that the removed baggage-compartment damaged lining covered ( AMM TASK 25-51-01-200-801- A/600). WARNING:WEAR GLOVES AND GOGGLES AND PREVENT CONTACT WITH SOLVENT VAPORS DURING THE CLEANING. (2) Clean the baggage compartment lining with Rhodiasolve E-23, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to remove dirt, oil, and debris. (3) Mask off the surface to keep the original paint intact outside the patch repair and on the adjacent border. (4) With a 320-400 grit sanding paper, fully remove the paint, primer and filler from the area where you will install the patch repair. NOTE: • Remove a minimum of 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) of paint on the border adjacent to the damage where you will install the patch. • Be careful not to go through the first layer when you sand the area. • Make sure that all filler or primers are also removed and the bare glass surface is exposed. (5) Wipe the surface after you sand it, with a clean, shop wipe soaked in Rhodiasolve E-23, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. NOTE: • Dry the surface with a clean dry shop wipe. Do not let the solvent evaporate from the part and make sure that there is no remaining contamination on it. • The part will be clean when you pass a clean, dry shop wipe on the surface and the shop wipe shows no indications of dirt, oil, or debris. • Do not touch the cleaned surfaces.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (6) Find the patch that correctly agrees with the damage and periphery area (see table 802) (Figure 801, Figure 802 and Figure 803). NOTE: • For repairs with one piece of patch, make sure that there is a border of liner material with 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) between the damage and the outer edge of the patch repair. • For repairs with two pieces of patches, make sure that there is a border of liner material with 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) between the damage and the outer edge of the patch repair. • Make sure that there is a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) in overlapping patches. • These materials can be trimmed as necessary. • To mark the periphery of the damage, you can use a compass if you think it will make your job easier. (7) Remove the protective liner from one corner of the patch and bond it to the panel periphery (Figure 804). NOTE: • Be careful not to contaminate the adhesive side of the patch. • Apply firm, positive pressure and smooth as necessary to prevent entrapped air. • Work the patch down over all the area. (8) Use a straightedge or rule to make sure that the edges of the patch are correctly bonded to the panel. NOTE: • The patch is not correctly bonded if the scale or straightedge can be placed below the patch and between the patch and liner more than 1.6 th millimeters (1/16 inch). • Push the edges down until the scale cannot slip between the liner and the patch. (9) If the adhesion is not sufficient, remove the patch and discard it. NOTE: • Clean the panel surface again, install a new patch, and do an inspection. • Obey these procedures to do the cleaning, the installation, and the inspection. (10)Install the baggage-compartment damaged lining back ( AMM TASK 25-51-01-400-801-A/400). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 25-51-01 Page 5 of 62 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

ASK FOR HELP TO MOVE THE LINERS AND BE CAREFUL TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE PARTS. (1) Remove the baggage-compartment damaged lining ( AMM TASK 25-51-01-000-801-A/ 400). (2) Make an inspection on the systems installed in the area that the removed baggage- compartment damaged lining covered ( AMM TASK 25-51-01-200-801-A/600). NOTE: These steps are not applicable when the damage is a scratch. (3) Find the damage size and make the decision on which side of the panel (front side or backside) you will repair. WARNING: WEAR GLOVES AND GOGGLES AND AVOID CONTACT WITH SOLVENT VAPORS DURING THE CLEANING. (4) Clean the baggage compartment lining with Rhodiasolve E-23, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to remove dirt, oil, and debris. (5) NOTE: The step that follows is applicable only to wet lay-up repair of the front side of the panel. With a 320-400 grit sandpaper, fully remove the paint from the area where you will install the repair. NOTE: • Mask off the surface to keep the original paint intact outside the repair and the adjacent border. • Remove a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) of paint on the border adjacent to the damage that you will repair. • Be careful not to go through the first layer when you sand the area. • Make sure that all filler or primers are also removed and the bare glass surface is exposed. (6) Wipe the surface with a clean shop wipe soaked in Rhodiasolve E-23, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol.

(7) Trim 3 plies of 7781 fiberglass to cover the damaged area and extend a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) past on all sides. NOTE: Put the fiberglass pieces on a table with release paper to prevent contamination of the resin on the shop benches. (8) Weigh the fiberglass plies. Use this figure as a start weight for the resin that you will mix for repair (Table 804). Table 804 - LAMINATING RESIN/CATALYST Laminating Resin : Catalyst (by weight) 100:10 (9) Mix Shell Resin 828 (laminating resin) and Epicure 3223 (catalyst). Resin mixture must cause a complete saturation of the glass to occur. (10) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of the resin on the 25-millimeter (1.0-inch) border past the panel damage. (11) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of resin on the first fiberglass ply. Use of a roller pin or dowel will help distribute the resin equally on the fiberglass ply. (12) Install the first fiberglass ply with resin on the damaged panel. Make sure that the patch extends a minimum 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) past the damage. (13) Use the resin and brush to distribute the resin and smooth the panel surface as necessary. (14) Install the second ply on the first ply. (15) Apply more resin on the surface of the panel. Make sure that the panel is fully soaked in the resin solution. (16) Install the third ply on the repair and apply more resin on the surface, as necessary to have a complete saturation. (17) You can use a nylon or Teflon paddle to help seat the plies onto the panel. NOTE: Apply pressure from one corner of the repair and work outward to prevent air bubbles. (18) Let the repair cure for a minimum of 6 hours. (19) Brush-apply, to the two sides of the panel, GP677D60 resin with GP4840 catalyst mixed 1:1 by weight.
