			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 25-61-00-400-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER SYSTEM (ELT SATORI) - PROGRAMMING A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to program ELT SATORI. (2) After the programming, the ELT has to be correctly registered with the local authority. For registration information, refer to the COSPAS-SARSAT site. NOTE: For a correct registration, the 15-digit hexadecimal code of the ELT is necessary. You can calculate it with the Hexadecimal code calculator for ELT96/97 available at Air Precision web site (www.airprecision.com). (3) The ELT96A9800 000 004 programming tool replaces the previous versions because of obsolescence and because its production stopped. This new version was developed as an improvement of the previous version and it is designed to program the aircraft registration in the 406 Mhz beacons ELT96A/ELT97A manufactured by Air Precision. B.

Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A (1) Remove ELT unit ( AMM TASK 25-61-01-000-802-A/400). (2) (ELT PROGRAMMING TOOL MODEL ELT96A9800 000 004) Do the installation of the ELT programming-tool software ELT96A9800 000 004-SW (ELT programmer software) as follows: (Figure 201) NOTE: It is recommended that you do not connect the ELT programming-tool hardware ELT96A9800 000 004 (programmer hardware) before the software installation. 1. Insert the ELT programmer software CD-ROM in the computer. 2. Use the CD-ROM "autorun" feature, on the context menu available for the CDrom.  By default, the installation program, installs the required drivers and the software. 3. If the automatic execution of the CD-ROM is “disable”, click with the mouse right button on the CD icon and choose “Installation (all)”, or run "install_all.bat" as found on the CD-ROM root directory. 4. Verify if a shortcut icon is created on the personal computer and "Start" menu.  The software shortcut is installed by default in “Programs\ELT96A9800 000004 - SW” (this directory can be changed during installation process). (3) (ELT PROGRAMMING TOOL MODEL ELT96A9800 000 004) Do the ELT programmer hardware connection as follows: NOTE: The ELT programmer hardware use an USB B type connector. The connection must be USB 2.0 version. 1. Make sure that the ELT is energized. 2. On the ELT, put the switch on the “OFF” position. 3. Connect the ELT programmer hardware to ELT connector. 4. Connect the ELT programmer hardware to an USB-USB cable (USB B type connector). 5. Connect the other end of the USB-USB cable (USB A type connector) to the personal computer. 6. During the ELT programmer hardware installation its LED can blink. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/200 25-61-00 Page 3 of 19 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL 7. Make sure that the LED on the ELT is "on". This LED will continue “on” while the programmer is connected. 8. On the personal computer, the Microsoft Windows detects the device as “ELT96A9800000004” and installs the virtual COM port drivers. (4) (ELT PROGRAMMING TOOL MODEL ELT96A9800 000 004) If the Microsoft Windows does not detect the device, do the check of the COM (communication) port as follows: NOTE: The procedure to access the Device Manager can vary with your Windows version. 1. On the Windows, open the Device Manager. To do this, click on the button Start, and then click on Control Panel (or Settings and then Control Panel). Click on System (or Performance and Maintenance, and then System). On the Hardware tab, click on Device Manager. 2. Double click “Ports (COM &amp; LPT)”. 3. Find the ELT96A9800000004 (ELT device) port recently detected. You will see the COM port number assigned right after the device name.  The COM port assignment to ELT device changes depending on your hardware configuration. Windows detects an unused COM port in your computer and assigns that port number to the new device. 4. Make sure you don't have any exclamation points or question marks on the ELT device. That means the driver is not correctly detected. 5. If the device is correctly detected, go to step 13. In case, of these symbols are present, follow the steps below. 6. Click with the mouse right button on the ELT device port and then click on Properties on the open menu. 7. Click on the tab “Port Settings”, and then on the button “Advanced”. 8. On the open window, select for example COM1 on the drop down list on COM Port Number. 9. If COM1 is already used by other device, try the next unused port number. 10. Click on the OK button for the Advanced Settings window and for Properties window. 11. Make sure you don't have any exclamation points or question marks on the ELT device. 12. In case of these symbols are present yet, that means the drive is not correctly detected and you must contact the manufacturer for more details (www.airprecision.com). 13. Close all dialog windows.
