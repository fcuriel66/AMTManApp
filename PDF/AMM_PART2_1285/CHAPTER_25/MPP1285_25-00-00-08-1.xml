			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Lightly sand the surface with 100-400 grit sandpaper to break surface gloss. NOTE: • Take care not to go through the first layer when you sand the area. • Clean all visible surface. Do not use force to sand the surface of the part or panel. Sand only the resin on the surface. • Do not sand the reinforcement material. (3) Do the steps below to repair on the surface of the part or panel with polyester-base filler compound (Figure 801). NOTE: Obey the manufacturer′s instructions to mix quantities of the polyester-base filler compound. (a) On a mixing tray, container or a cardboard palette, put some polyester-base filler compound (1). Use one of the types of Part-A polyester-base filler compound (1) listed in the Table 804. NOTE: Akemi No. 4 and No. 7 have the same handling and filling characteristics. The difference between them is that the Akemi No. 4 has a faster cure time. (b) Put some Part-B hardener (2) straight from the tube onto the palette. The Part-B hardener (2) is white and has the same consistency as toothpaste. Use the corresponding Part-B hardener (2) listed on the Table 804.

NOTE: • If there are witness holes in the plastic strip or metallic panel, place the adhesive on the composite material surface. • To bond metallic surfaces to carbon composite with the use of a glass scrim cloth, press the glass cloth onto the adhesive and allow it to squeeze through the cloth. Add more adhesive to make sure that the opposite side of the glass is completely soaked with adhesive. (9) Press the surfaces to be bonded onto the panel adhesive. NOTE: • Insure that adhesive resin can be seen "squeezing out" from all four sides. • If you bond a metallic surfaces to carbon composite, remember that the glass cloth or glass filler will not allow you to squeeze out all of the glue, it controls the bondline to the thickness of the glass, so good pressure is essential. • If there are witness holes in the detail, make sure that adhesive flows out of these locations. • Do not remove excess adhesive in witness holes. • It is acceptable to remove excess from edges, with the use of a spatula, tongue depressor or similar tool. (10) When bonded, there must be a uniform "Bondline". NOTE: • The width of the adhesive used to join to surfaces is the bondline. Normally, adhesives perform better with a uniform but thin bondline. • Bondline thickness 0.05 to 0.8 mm (0.002 to 0.030 in).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Use an additional repair ply (in the same fabric as that originally used in the top ply in the case of hybrid composites) to minimize surface depression when plies are replaced. • The resin content of the impregnated fabric must be 55 ÃÂ± 5 percent by weight. 2 2 • For damage larger than 103.0 cm (16 in ), you must replace the panel. 2 2 • For damage less than 103.0 cm (16 in ), use any resin epoxy used for solid-laminate. (b) Cut the replacement plies to the necessary dimensions. There must be a 25.4 mm (1 in) overlap. (c) Mark the area to receive the repair layers with adhesive tape, with a 25 mm (1 in) margin for the additional layer to settle. (d) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of the resin onto the repair area. Refer to Figure 822, sheet 1. (e) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of resin on the first ply. (f) Install the first ply with resin on the damaged panel. Refer to Figure 822, sheet 1. (g) NOTE: Laminate the first ply in the position in which it will be saturated with resin. • Use of a roller pin or dowel will help distribute the resin evenly on the ply. Refer to Figure 822, sheet 2. • The repair plies must be installed in the same sequence as that of the original plies repaired, in the case of hybrid composites. (h) Apply pressure from one corner of the repair and work outward to prevent air bubbles. (i) Install subsequent plies as necessary and do the procedures for each replaced ply. NOTE: The number of plies will depend on the fabric style used. Use the number of plies necessary to restore the piece thickness. (6) To cure the repair, obey the resin manufacturer ′s instructions. (a) Examine the patch to make sure that it is free from pits, blisters, starved areas, and excess resin deposits. (7) To refinish parts, do as follows: CAUTION:DO NOT SAND INTO THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE. NOT TO DECREASE THE STRENGTH OF THE COMPONENT.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Make sure that the panel has an only one thickness. If necessary, sand the area with No. 180 sandpaper, fine abrasive. Keep a geometric shape (oval, circular or rectangular) until you get a uniform surface. (b) Apply the polyurethane paint to the repaired surface if the original paint was removed. NOTE: The commercially available paint is not the same as the original. Thus the finishing parts will not look very similar to the original part. (c) Remove the adhesive tape and the clean surface with Isopropyl Alcohol. NOTE: Do not permit the solvent to evaporate on the part and make sure that there is no contamination on it. (8) Material substitution: (a) The substitution for fiberglass materials, when the "as manufactured" material is not available or not in stock, is shown in Table 823.
