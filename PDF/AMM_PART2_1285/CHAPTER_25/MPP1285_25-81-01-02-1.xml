			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 25-81-01-800-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. THERMOACOUSTIC INSULATION - DISPLACEMENT A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the thermoacoustic insulation pads displacement. (2) Displace the thermoacoustic insulation pads as necessary, to do the maintenance action and to provide a proper access to the applicable area. (3) The thermoacoustic insulation pads are installed to the fuselage structure (between frame/ bulkhead), to the doors, to the emergency exits, and under the floor panels, at zones 113, 114, 123, 124, 131, 132, 141, 142, 151 through 154, 161, 162, 171, 172, 213, 214, 223 through 226, 231 through 234, 241 through 244, 251 through 254, 261 through 264, and 271 through 274.

Preparation SUBTASK 010-002-A WARNING: MAKE SURE THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS IN A SAFE CONDITION BEFORE YOU DO THE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. THIS IS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND/OR DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (1) Do the procedure to make the aircraft safe for maintenance. (2) Make sure that there is no signs of rips, tears, or other damage to the thermoacoustic insulation pads. If not, replace it according to (AMM MPP 25-81-01/400). J. Thermoacoustic Insulation - Displacement (Figure 201)  (Figure 202)  CAUTION:BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE THE MECHANISMS INSTALLED NEAR THE AFFECTED AREA. CAUTION: BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU REMOVE ADHESIVE TAPE FROM THE THERMOACOUSTIC INSULATION PADS. A SUDDEN MOVEMENT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE THERMOACOUSTIC INSULATION PADS. SUBTASK 020-002-A (1) Remove the frame clip (1). (2) Remove the adhesive tape (2) in three sides of the external insulation. (3) Do the displacement to the direction of the remaining side which the attaching parts was not removed. NOTE: If necessary, remove and reinstall any attachment component (retainer, firtree, etc.) to gain access to the work area. (4) Remove or displace the internal blanket (4) as required to perform the maintenance action in the applicable area. (5) Do the applicable maintenance procedure. (6) Reinstall the internal insulation (4). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 800-801-A/200 25-81-01 Page 3 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (7) Reattach the external insulation to its position. Use the same adhesive tape (2) and frame clip (1). NOTE: If necessary, replace the adhesive tape, cut the adhesive tape 50R10-820 to the same dimension as it was installed. Put the adhesive tape 50R10-820 in the same position as it was in the thermoacoustic insulation pads. (8) Remove the frame clip (1), remove the adhesive tape (2) from the remaining side of the insulation in order to displaced it to gain access to the area which was not previously inspected. (9) Displace the internal insulation (4) as required to perform the maintenance action in the applicable area. (10) Do the applicable maintenance procedure to the remaining side. (11) Reinstall the internal insulation (4). (12) Reattach the external insulation to its position, install the adhesive tape (2) and frame clip (1). NOTE: If necessary, replace the adhesive tape, cut the adhesive tape 50R10-820 to the same dimension as it was installed. Put the adhesive tape 50R10-820 in the same position as it was in the thermoacoustic insulation pads. (13) Make sure that the thermoacoustic insulation pads were reinstalled in accordance with installation task (AMM MPP 25-81-01/400). K. Follown SUBTASK 030-002-A (1) Make sure that the aircraft is in the same configuration as it was at the beginning of the displacement task.
