			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 25-50-01-300-802-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 3. ANTI-BLOCKAGE BARRIER (SPLICE AND ATTACHMENTS) - REPAIR A. General (1) This task gives the instructions to repair the nylon webbing and to replace the attachment anchor plates and buckles of the anti-blockage barrier net. (2) The repair must be done when damage to the anti-blockage barrier net is suspected. (3) Do an inspection of the anti blockage barrier net as follows: NOTE: The conditions below must be obeyed to replace the nylon webbing. (a) Replace the webbing as follows: 1 If there are more than two longitudinal fibers broken. 2 If two or more transversal fibers regardless of extent are broken or missing. 3 If there are abrasion marks which cause rupture of fibers or nap sufficient to obscure the identity of fiber with more than 0.10 in width or 2.54 cm (1 inch) in length. 4 If there are abrasion marks which cause difference in stiffness or thickness of webbing and go for more than 0.635 cm (1/4 inch) in the length direction. 5 Replace the web if you find a cut, hole or tear. 6 Replace the web if it has knots. 7 Replace the web if it has a twist or distortion. 8 If there are two or more yarns per shed. (4) It is not necessary to replace the webbing when the wear is considered an acceptable damage as follows: (a) Fibers are not cut, discontinuous or broken. NOTE: This kind of abrasion reduces the diameter of exterior web fibers, but does not reduce performance or safety margins. (b) If there are flat abrasions and worn fibers which causes no longer than 30% of the thickness of the fibers and 10% of the webbing width. (c) Broken Fibers: if there are visible on one or two ends within the same length and no longer than 22,86 cm (9 inches). (d) If there are abrasion marks which cause difference in stiffness or thickness of webbing and go for less than 0.635 cm (1/4 inch) in the length direction.
