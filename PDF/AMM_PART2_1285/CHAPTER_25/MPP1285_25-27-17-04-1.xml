			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (d) Clean the setscrews (1) and remove residual grease from it. Apply a small amount of thread-locking compound to the setscrews. Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. (e) Use a 5/64" allen wrench to tighten the setscrews (1) into the knob assemblies (2). Let 1-2 threads exposed. Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. (f) Set the cam (7) inside the knobs in the vertical position, parallel to setscrew axis. Refer to DET. C, Figure 401. (g) Set the cam slots (8), in the spindles (6), in the vertical position. Refer to DET. B and DET. E, Figure 401. (h) Apply the sealant to the escutcheon (3). Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. (i) Install the escutcheon (3) to the door panel. Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. (j) Connect the knob assemblies (2) to the spindles (6). Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. (k) Insert the key and slightly rotate it in either direction to ensure the correct engagement. (l) Carefully, but firmly, press the knob assemblies (2) to their stops. Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. NOTE: The passenger knob assembly (2) should stop with a small gap between it and the escutcheon (3). Because of slight variations in the doors, this gap does not always exist. (m) Tighten the setscrews (1) until they are approximately flush with the diameter of the knob assemblies (2) neck. Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. NOTE: Make sure that the knob assemblies (2) are correctly attached to the spindles (6) and the key is functional. CAUTION: IN THE NEXT STEP DO NOT TIGHTEN THE SETSCREWS (1) TOO MUCH. THIS CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO INTERNAL COMPONENTS AND MAKE THE LOCK INOPERATIVE. (n) Tighten the setscrews (1) 3/4 to 1 additional full turn to a sub-flush condition. Refer to DET. B, Figure 401. (o) Use a spatula or razor to remove all excess of sealant. (p) Do an operational check of the latch (thumb turn included).
