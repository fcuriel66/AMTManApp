			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL EQUIPMENT/FURNISHINGS - CLEANING/PAINTING EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General CAUTION: OBEY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS DURING THE CLEANING OPERATIONS: • MAKE SURE THAT THE CLEANING OPERATIONS ON ADJACENT SURFACES DO NOT CAUSE THE SURFACES ALREADY CLEANED TO BECOME DIRTY AGAIN. • REMOVE THE STAINS IMMEDIATELY. THERE ARE STAINS THAT YOU CANNOT REMOVE AFTER SOME TIME. • DO NOT USE FLAMMABLE SOLVENTS ON THE AIRCRAFT. • DO NOT APPLY SPRAY SOLVENT. • KEEP THE SOLVENTS IN CLOSED CONTAINERS. • DO NOT USE METAL ACCESSORIES (STEEL WOOD, STEEL WIRE BRUSH, ETC.) TO CLEAN THE AIRCRAFT. • DO NOT USE CHLORINATED AND FLUOROCARBON SOLVENTS ON ACRYLIC, POLYCARBONATE, AND POLYSULFONE PLASTICS OR IN AREAS PAINTED WITH WATER-BASE PAINTS. THESE SOLVENTS CAN CAUSE SUCH A DAMAGE TO THESE MATERIALS THAT YOU CANNOT REPAIR. • DO NOT PERMIT THE ETHYL-ALCOHOL SOLUTION TO TOUCH THE POLYCARBONATE PARTS. • DO NOT CLEAN DECALS WITH ORGANIC SOLVENTS (METHYL-ETHYL-KETONE, ALCOHOL, CHLORINATED SOLVENTS, FLUORINATED SOLVENTS, ETC.). THE MATERIAL IS NOT RESISTANT TO ORGANIC SOLVENTS. • DO NOT APPLY SPRAY CLEANERS TO ACOUSTIC INSULATION OR PERFORATED SURFACES. USE A CLOTH MOIST WITH THE APPLICABLE CLEANER. • DO NOT USE SOAP, LAUNDRY DETERGENT, AUTOMATIC DISHWASHER DETERGENT, OR STRONG HOUSEHOLD CLEANERS TO CLEAN THE SURFACES. A. This section gives the procedure to clean of the aircraft interior. B. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below.
