			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Clean the forward baggage compartment partition with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to remove dirt, oil, and debris. (2) Mask off the surface to keep the original chemical treatment intact outside the patch repair and on the adjacent border. (3) With a 320-400 grit sanding paper, fully remove the chemical treatment from the area where you will install the patch repair. NOTE: Remove the chemical treatment at least 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) on the adjacent border of the damage where you will install the patch. (4) Wipe the surface after you sand it, with a clean, shop wipe soaked with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. NOTE: • Dry the surface with a clean dry shop wipe. Do not permit the solvent to evaporate from the part and make sure that there is no remaining contamination on it. • The part will be clean when a clean, dry shop wipe can be passed over the surface and show no indications of dirt, oil, or debris. • Do not touch the cleaned surfaces. (5) Find the patch that correctly agrees with the damage and periphery area (see table 801) (Figure 801). NOTE: • For repairs with one piece of patch, make sure that there is a border of liner material with 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) between the damage and the outer edge of the patch repair. • For repairs with two pieces of patches, make sure that there is a border of liner material with 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) between the damage and the outer edge of the patch repair. • Make sure that there is a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) in overlapping patches. • These materials can be trimmed as necessary. • To mark the periphery of the damage, you can use a compass if you think it will make your job easier. (6) Remove the protective liner from one corner of the patch and bond it to the partition periphery (Figure 802). NOTE: • Be careful not to contaminate the adhesive side of the patch. • Apply firm, positive pressure and smooth as necessary to prevent entrapped air. • Work the patch down all over the area. (7) Use a straightedge or rule to make sure that the edges of the patch are correctly bonded to the partition.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: • The patch is not correctly bonded if the scale or straightedge can be placed below the patch and between the patch and liner more than 1.6 th millimeters (1/16 inch). • Push the edges down until the scale cannot slip between the liner and the patch. (8) If the adhesion is not sufficient, remove the patch and discard it. NOTE: • Clean the partition surface again, install a new patch, and do an inspection. • Obey the above procedures to do the cleaning, the installation, and the inspection.
