			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • WARNING: KEEP SOLVENTS AWAY FROM SOURCES OF HEAT, FIRE, OR SPARKS, WHICH CAN CAUSE AN EXPLOSION. • PREVENT CONTACT OF SOLVENT WITH SKIN, EYES, AND CLOTHING. WEAR EYE PROTECTION AND USE MECHANICAL VENTILATION OR RESPIRATORY PROTECTION WHEN YOU WORK IN A CONFINED SPACE OR AREA. TO BREATHE VAPORS OR PERMIT SOLVENT TO TOUCH YOUR SKIN OR EYES IS DANGEROUS. CAUTION:DO NOT PUT PARTS FULLY INTO SOLVENT AND, DURING THE CLEANING, REMOVE THE SOLVENT QUICKLY TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE PART. (a) Remove all sanding dust with oil-free compressed air. (b) Clean surface with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, a minimum of 12.70 mm (0.50 in) more than the limits of the sanded area. NOTE: Let the solvent evaporate for a few minutes before you continue with the repair. (5) To replace the plies, do these steps: (a) Select fabrics (refer to Tables 802 and 803), with material of the same type and orientation as those of the original fabric. NOTE: • Follow the orientation of Table 802 to replace the correct quantity of plies for each type of fabric. • Use an additional repair ply (in the same fabric as that originally used in the top ply in the case of hybrid composites) to minimize surface depression when plies are replaced. • The resin content of the impregnated fabric must be 55 ÃÂ± 5 percent by weight. 2 2 • For damage larger than 103.0 cm (16 in ), use the specified resin epoxy show in Table 804. 2 2 • For damages less than 103.0 cm (16 in ), use any resin epoxy used for solid-laminate. (b) Cut the replacement plies to the necessary dimensions. There must be a 25.4 mm (1 in) overlap. (c) Mark the area to receive the repair layers with adhesive tape, with a 25 mm (1 in) margin for the additional layer to settle. (d) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of the resin epoxy onto the repair area. Refer to Figure 801, sheet 1. (e) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of resin on the first ply. (f) Install the first ply with resin on the damaged panel. Refer to Figure 801, sheet 1. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-801-A/800 25-13-00 Page 6 of 23 Rev 52 - Apr 28/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (g) NOTE: Laminate the first ply in the position in which it will be saturated with resin. • Use of a roller pin or dowel will help distribute the resin evenly on the ply. Refer to Figure 801, sheet 2. • The repair plies must be installed in the same sequence as that of the original plies repaired, in the case of hybrid composites. (h) Apply pressure from one corner of the repair and work outward to prevent air bubbles. (i) Install subsequent plies as necessary and do the procedures for each replaced ply. NOTE: • The maximum permitted number of plies acceptable for each repair is six plies. • Each type-7781 or 1581 fiberglass is equivalent to two style-120 fiberglass plies. (6) To cure the repair, do these steps: WARNING: USE HEAT CURING EQUIPMENT THAT IS PERMITTED BY THE LOCAL FIRE PROTECTION AUTHORITIES. TO PREVENT CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONNEL. CAUTION:SURFACE TEMPERATURE MUST NOT EXCEED 77ÃÂ°C (170ÃÂ°F). DAMAGE OR DISTORTION OF STRUCTURE CAN OCCUR IF THE TEMPERATURE OFF IS MORE THAN 77ÃÂ°C (170ÃÂ°F). (a) Let the repair cure at room temperature, or accelerate the cure with heat until 77ÃÂ°C (170ÃÂ°F) are got. NOTE: • Obey Table 804 to use the curing time indicated for specified epoxy resin. • If the heat lamp is used as a heat source to accelerate the cure, a variation of 3.9ÃÂ°C (7ÃÂ°F) per minute will be permitted and the lamp height above the parts must be according to Table 805. • Curing time does not include the time necessary for the mold and part to heat up the correct temperature. Curing time is the period after the part has got that temperature. (b) Examine the patch to make sure that it is free from pits, blisters, starved areas, and excess resin deposits. (7) To refinish parts, do as follows: CAUTION:DO NOT SAND INTO THE ORIGINAL STRUCTURE. NOT TO DECREASE THE STRENGTH OF THE COMPONENT. (a) Make sure that the panel has an only one thickness. If necessary, sand the area with No. 180 sandpaper, fine abrasive. Keep a geometric shape (oval, circular or rectangular) until you get a uniform surface.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: Paint removal should extend at least 12.5 millimeters (0.5 inches) beyond the border of the damage where you will install the patch. (b) Wipe the surface after you sand it, with a clean shop wipe soaked with ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. NOTE: • Dry the surface with a clean dry shop wipe. Do not permit the solvent to evaporate from the part and make sure that there is no remaining contamination on it. • The part will be clean when a clean, dry shop wipe can be passed over the surface and show no indications of dirt, oil, or debris. • Do not touch the cleaned surfaces. (c) Set the correct patch Lexan F6006 series according to color. (d) Use any type of adhesive to bond the patch Lexan F6006 series to the panel. NOTE: • Embraer suggest to use adhesive HE 1908. 2 2 • If the damage is larger than 103.0 cm (16 in ), you must replace the panel. • Be careful not to contaminate the adhesive of the patch. • Apply firm, positive pressure and smooth as necessary to prevent entrapped air. • Work the patch down over all the area. (e) Use a straightedge or rule to make sure that the edges of the patch are correctly bonded to the panel. NOTE: • The patch is not correctly bonded if a scale or straightedge can penetrate more than 1.6 millimeters between the patch and liner th (1/16 inch). • Push the edges down until the scale cannot slip between the liner and the patch. (f) If the adhesion is not sufficient, remove the patch and discard it.
