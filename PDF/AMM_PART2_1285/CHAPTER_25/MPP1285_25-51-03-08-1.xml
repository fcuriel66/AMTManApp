General (1) This task gives the procedures to repair the aft pressure bulkhead with patches: NOTE: There are two patches certified for this repair: AKRO Fireguard Speed Patch, AF 800 Series, and Permaglass Cargo Lining Repair Patch, 100 Series. (2) For these patch repairs, no set-up or cure time is necessary. The aircraft can be put back into service immediately. (3) The minimum distance between two patch repairs must be 38 millimeters (1.5 inches). (4) Refer to table 801 and Figure 801 for the maximum and types of damage that can be repaired.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Mask off the surface to keep the original paint intact outside the patch repair and on the adjacent border. (3) With a 320-400 grit sanding paper, fully remove the paint, primer and filler from the area where you will install the patch repair. NOTE: • Remove the paint at least 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) on the adjacent border of the damage where you will install the patch. • Be careful not to go through the first layer when you sand the area. • Make sure that all filler or primers are also removed and the bare glass surface is exposed. (4) Wipe the surface after you sand it, with a clean, shop wipe soaked with Rhodiasolve E-23, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. NOTE: • Dry the surface with a clean dry shop wipe. Do not permit the solvent to evaporate from the part and make sure that there is no remaining contamination on it. • The part will be clean when a clean, dry shop wipe can be passed over the surface and show no indications of dirt, oil, or debris. • Do not touch the cleaned surfaces. (5) Find the patch that correctly agrees with the damage and periphery area (see table 801) (Figure 801). NOTE: • For repairs with one piece of patch, make sure that there is a border of liner material with 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) between the damage and the outer edge of the patch repair. • For repairs with two pieces of patches, make sure that there is a border of liner material with 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) between the damage and the outer edge of the patch repair. • Make sure that there is a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) in overlapping patches. • These materials can be trimmed as necessary. • To mark the periphery of the damage, you can use a compass if you think it will make your job easier. (6) Remove the protective liner from one corner of the patch and bond it to the partition periphery (Figure 802). NOTE: • Be careful not to contaminate the adhesive side of the patch. • Apply firm, positive pressure and smooth as necessary to prevent entrapped air. • Work the patch down over all the area.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (7) Use a straightedge or rule to make sure that the edges of the patch are correctly bonded to the panel. NOTE: • The patch is not correctly bonded if the scale or straightedge can be placed below the patch and between the patch and liner more than 1.6 th millimeters (1/16 inch). • Push the edges down until the scale cannot slip between the liner and the patch. (8) If the adhesion is not sufficient, remove the patch and discard it. NOTE: • Clean the partition surface again, install a new patch, and do an inspection. • Obey the above procedures to do the cleaning, the installation, and the inspection.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Remove a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) of paint on the border adjacent to the damage where the repair will be done. • Be careful not to go through the first layer when you sand the area. • Make sure that all filler or primers are also removed and the bare glass surface is exposed. (5) Wipe the surface with a clean, shop wipe soaked with Rhodiasolve E-23, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. NOTE: • Dry the surface with a clean dry shop wipe. Do not permit the solvent to evaporate on the part and make sure that there is no remaining contamination on it. • The part will be clean when a clean, dry shop wipe can be passed over the surface and show no indications of dirt, oil, or debris. • Do not touch the cleaned surfaces. (6) Trim 3 plies of 7781 fiberglass to cover the damaged area and extend a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) past on all sides. NOTE: Put the fiberglass pieces on a table with release paper to prevent contamination of the resin on the shop benches. (7) Weigh the fiberglass plies. Use this figure as start weight for resin to be mixed for repair (Table 803). Table 803 - LAMINATING RESIN/CATALYST Laminating Resin : Catalyst (by weight) 100:10 (8) Mix Shell Resin 828 (laminating resin) and Epicure 3223 (catalyst). Resin mixture must cause a complete saturation of the glass to occur. (9) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of the resin on the 25-millimeter (1.0-inch) border past the partition damage. (10) With a paint brush, apply a small quantity of resin on the first fiberglass ply. Use of a roller pin or dowel will help distribute the resin equally on the fiberglass ply. (11) Install the first fiberglass ply with resin on the damaged panel. Make sure that the patch extends a minimum of 25 millimeters (1.0 inch) past the damage. (12) Use the resin and brush to distribute the resin and smooth the partition surface as necessary. (13) Install the second ply on the first ply. (14) Apply more resin on the surface of the panel. Make sure that the partition is fully soaked in the resin solution. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-802-A/800 25-51-03 Page 13 of 16 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (15) Install the third ply on the repair and apply more resin on the surface, as necessary to have a complete saturation. (16) Use of a nylon or Teflon paddle to help seat the plies onto the partition is recommended. NOTE: Apply pressure from one corner of the repair and work outward to prevent air bubbles. (17) Let the repair cure for a minimum of 6 hours. (18) Brush-apply to the side of the partition, GP667D60 resin with GP4840 catalyst mixed 1:1 by weight. NOTE: • Try to make a uniform coat with a minimum thickness of 0.08 millimeters (0.003 inches). • Additional resin does not affect performance. (19) Before you finish, let the resin cure for 8 hours. NOTE: • The partition can be returned to service or painted as desired. • Do not remove the GP667D60 resin if you apply a finish. (20) Sand the area softly and paint with WLS P/N 412-109 to finish the repair, if applicable. (21) Install the aft pressure bulkhead ( AMM TASK 25-51-03-400-801-A/400).
