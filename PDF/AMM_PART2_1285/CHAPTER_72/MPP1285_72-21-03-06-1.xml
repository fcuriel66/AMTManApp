			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (11) Apply an adhesive strip of reflective tape P/N Chadwick &amp; Helmuth 10444 to the fan spinner. The strip of reflective tape must be coincident with one of the mass balance attaching points. (12) Energize the aircraft with a DC Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200) or start the APU ( AMM TASK 49-10-00-910-802-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C11 or AMM TASK 49-13-00-910-802-A/200 for APU T-62T-40C14). (13) Energize the balancer/analyzer instrument with 28 V DC. Use the 28 V DC source of the aft galley (see figure 601) or use an 28 V DC external power supply and see if the equipment starts the self-test routine. NOTE: To energize with 28 V DC, it is necessary to PUSH the related circuit breaker and push the hot jug button to the ON position. Refer to figure 601. J. Engine Fan Trim Balance (Figure 601)  (Figure 602)   (Figure 603)  SUBTASK 750-002-A (1) NOTE: The Fan Trim Balance procedure is done with the engine in operation, on the ground, with the rotor speed equal to 87% of N1. If the pressure altitude/ ambient temperature does not permit the engine to get 87% of N1, do the engine fan balance at a later date or try to balance at a slightly lower N1 speed limited to a minimum value of 85%. Engine Fan Trim Balance • WARNING: BEFORE YOU APPLY POWER TO THE ENGINE, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS NEAR THE ENGINE EXHAUST AREA ( AMM MPP 71-00-00/200). THIS WILL PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS. • WHEN YOU USE THE STROBE LIGHT WITH THE ENGINE IN OPERATION, WEAR EARPLUGS TO PROTECT YOUR EARS. VERY HIGH NOISE CAN CAUSE HARM TO YOUR EARS. • BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU OPERATE THE STROBE LIGHT TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT.

THESE OBJECTS CAN GO INTO THE ENGINE AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO IT. • TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER AIRCRAFT NEAR THE EXHAUST AREA ( AMM MPP 71-00-00/200). • TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT, PUT CHOCKS AT THE AIRCRAFT WHEELS AND SET THE PARKING BRAKE AND NORMAL BRAKES. • WHEN YOU OPERATE THE STROBE LIGHT, BE CAREFUL WITH LOOSE ITEMS SUCH AS PENS, PENCILS, IDENTIFICATION BADGE, GLASSES OR OTHER SMALL ITEMS. THESE ITEMS CAN GO INTO THE ENGINE AND CAUSE DAMAGE TO IT. (a) Do the fan balance trim. Obey the instructions of the balancer/analyzer equipment help menu or instructions given in EMB-145LP Fan Balance User Guide No. 14683-3R. (2) Balance Mass Installation. WARNING: • DO NOT TOUCH THE COMPONENTS OF THE ENGINE AND AIR INTAKE (IF IN ICING CONDITION) UNTIL THEY ARE COOL. THE TEMPERATURE STAYS HIGH AFTER THE ENGINE STOPS. THE HIGH TEMPERATURES CAN CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONS. • REFER TO THE GROUND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 71-00-00/200 WHEN YOU INSTALL THE FAN MASS BALANCES TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. CAUTION: • THE ATTACHMENT POINTS ON THE FAN SPINNER (12 POINTS) ARE USED TO INSTALL THE MASS BALANCES. • INSTALL ONLY ONE MASS BALANCE AT EACH ATTACHMENT POINT. • DO NOT INSTALL A FLAT WASHER AT THE ATTACHMENT POINT WHERE YOU INSTALL THE MASS BALANCE. • A MAXIMUM OF 5 BALANCE BOLT LOCATIONS CAN BE USED AT EACH OF THE 12 POSITIONS. • THE TOTAL FAN MASS LIMIT IS 45.5 GRAMS. • THE ONLY AVAILABLE MASS BALANCES ARE THOSE WITH THE P/N GIVEN IN THE ROLLS-ROYCE IPC (72-00-21). (a) Install the fan mass balances at the fan spinner attachment points as necessary. Obey the instructions below: 1 Remove the bolt from the fan spinner.
