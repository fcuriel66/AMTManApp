			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 28-21-11-300-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. FUEL FLEXIBLE HOSE - REPAIR A. General (1) This procedure gives the instructions for the repair of the engine and the APU fuel flexible hoses. (2) This instruction is applicable to the left and right engines. (3) A repair sleeve is not necessary if the silicone cover is gouged, nicked, abraded or cut to a depth of 0.030 inch or less. Damage deeper than this must be repaired, to keep the hose with its original fire resistance. (4) Do a check on the worn locations where the wire braid is exposed. Replace the hose if its reinforcement wire is damaged. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task On damaged hose I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-002-A WARNING: BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 71-00-00/200 AND AMM MPP 28-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO THE PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO THE MATERIAL. (1) Make sure that the aircraft is safe for maintenance. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • START 1/2. • FUEL PUMPS 1A/1B/1C. • FUEL PUMPS 2A/2B/2C. • APU CONTROL. • APU FUEL SOV. (3) If necessary, remove the LH or RH engine fuel hose from the engine and install caps to the open fittings (Figure 801). Refer to AMM MPP 73-21-01/400. (4) If necessary, remove the APU fuel hose and install caps to the open fittings (Figure 802). Refer to the APU replacement procedure. J. Fuel Flexible Hose - Repair (Figure 803)  SUBTASK 360-002-A (1) To find the correct width of the firesleeve , measure the damage and add one inch beyond abrasion at each end. To have the correct length, roll out the firesleeve as sufficient to wrap it around the hose twice. Then cut the firesleeve. • For engines, use firesleeve AE272-11. • For APU, use firesleeve AE272-6. (2) Clean the damaged area with a cloth moist with isopropyl alcohol. Let it dry for 15 minutes. Fill the damaged area with RTV106 silicone to the original hose diameter. (3) Turn the repair sleeve inside out and wrap it around the hose. (4) Apply a bead of silicone on the hose along the full length of the repair sleeve near the top edge. Then apply a bead of silicone along the length of the repair sleeve but let a margin near the sleeve edge be dry. (5) Wrap the repair sleeve around the hose and apply a bead of silicone under the outer edge along the full length of the sleeve.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (6) Push firmly along the repair sleeve edge. (7) Remove excess silicone. (8) Apply one wrap of lockwire approximately 1/2-inch from each end of the repair sleeve and draw tight with 4 or 5 twists of the wire. (9) Wrap the wire ends back around the repair sleeve in the opposite direction and apply 4 or 5 twists. Cut off the ends and bend them toward the hose. NOTE: If the repair sleeve is 6 inches or longer, attach it with lockwire at each 3 inches. (10) Seal the ends of the repair sleeve with silicone to prevent wicking. (11) You can also apply silicone on the twisted wire ends to prevent snagging. Wait silicone to cure for 4 hours before you install the hose back, if applicable. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove the caps from the disconnected points, if applicable. (2) Install the engine fuel hose (Figure 801), if applicable. Refer to AMM MPP 73-21-01/400. (3) Install the APU fuel hose (Figure 802), if applicable. Refer to the APU replacement procedure. • After hose installation, use sealant PS700 at the support assembly (Figure 802). (4) To prevent new damage, make sure that the fuel hose is not stressed and does not rub against other surfaces. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, close these circuit breakers and remove the tag from them: • STAR 1/2. • FUEL PUMPS 1A/1B/1C. • FUEL PUMPS 2A/2B/2C. • APU CONTROL. • APU FUEL SOV. (6) For the APU, set the APU master switch to ON. (7) Set the applicable fuel pump to on and do a check for leaks at the fuel hose. (8) Set the applicable fuel pump to off. (9) For the APU, set the APU master switch to OFF. (10) Put the aircraft back to its usual configuration.
