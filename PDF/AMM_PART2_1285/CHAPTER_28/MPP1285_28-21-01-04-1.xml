			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Do a check to know if the hole for the electrical fuel pump connector in the internal side of the fuel tank wall is prepared for bonding. If the electrical connector hole is not prepared, do steps from (a) to (e) (Figure 404). If the surface is prepared, go to step (2): NOTE: The surface is prepared when its painting is removed. (a) Determine the area to be bonded: 1 Do a mark around the hole for the electrical connector in the fuel tank wall. This mark must be 39 mm (1.53 inch) in diameter. (b) Remove the nonconductive coating from the area to be bonded 1 Apply a brush impregnated with Ardrox 2871. 2 Remove the coating with an acrylic spatula. WARNING: DO NOT MIX ALODYNE WITH ORGANIC SOLVENTS (ALCOHOLS, KETONES, ETC.). WHEN YOU MIX ALODYNE AND ORGANIC SOLVENTS, AN EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR AND CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONNEL AND DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT. CAUTION:DO NOT PUT CLEANING CLOTHS, BRUSH, OR SPONGES INTO SOLVENT CONTAINER TO PREVENT SOLVENT CONTAMINATION. CONTAMINATED SOLVENT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (c) Clean the surface with a cloth soaked with solvent. Before the solvent evaporation, clean the surface with a clean dry cloth. (d) After cleaning, with a brush, apply a thin coat of Alodyne to the prepared surface and wait until the surface is amber. NOTE: The pot life of the Alodyne 1200S solution is 24 hours. (e) Clean the base of the fuel pump connector with a cloth soaked with solvent. Before the solvent evaporation, clean the base of the fuel pump connector with a clean dry cloth. (2) Remove the protection caps from the disconnected points, if applicable. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE ATTACHING BOLTS, NUTS, WASHERS, FUEL LINE FITTINGS AND FAYING SURFACES BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL FUEL PUMP AND THE FUEL TANK SUPPORT ARE CLEAN TO PREVENT AN UNSATISFACTORY ELECTRICAL BONDING. (3) Prepare the fuel pump base surface for bonding. Do the bonding procedures, method 3 (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200). (4) Put the electrical fuel pump (5) in its installation position, on the fuel tank support. (5) Put the bolts (7) and washers (8) in their installation position. Tighten the bolts. (6) Do the bonding protection procedures for the fuel pump base ( AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-802-A/200).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (a) Determine the area to be bonded: 1 Do a mark around the hole for the electrical connector in the fuel tank wall. This mark must be 39 mm (1.53 inch) in diameter. (b) Remove the nonconductive coating from the area to be bonded. 1 Apply a brush impregnated with remover Ardrox 2871. 2 Remove the coating with an acrylic spatula. WARNING: DO NOT MIX ALODYNE WITH ORGANIC SOLVENTS (ALCOHOLS, KETONES, ETC.). WHEN YOU MIX ALODYNE AND ORGANIC SOLVENTS, AN EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR AND CAUSE INJURY TO PERSONNEL AND DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT. CAUTION:DO NOT PUT CLEANING CLOTHS, BRUSH, OR SPONGES INTO SOLVENT CONTAINER TO PREVENT SOLVENT CONTAMINATION. CONTAMINATED SOLVENT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE EQUIPMENT. (c) Clean the surface with a cloth soaked with solvent. Before the solvent evaporation, clean the surface with a clean dry cloth. (d) After cleaning with a brush, apply a thin coat of Alodyne to the prepared surface and wait until the surface is amber. NOTE: The pot life of the Alodyne 1200S solution is 24 hours. (e) Clean the base of the fuel pump connector with a cloth soaked in solvent. Before the solvent evaporation, clean the base of the fuel pump connector with a clean dry cloth. (2) Remove the protection caps from the disconnected points, if applicable. CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE ATTACHING BOLTS, NUTS, WASHERS, FUEL LINE FITTINGS AND FAYING SURFACES BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL FUEL PUMP AND THE FUEL TANK SUPPORT ARE CLEAN TO PREVENT AN UNSATISFACTORY ELECTRICAL BONDING. (3) Prepare the fuel pump base surface for bonding. Do the bonding procedures, method 3 (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200). (4) Put the electrical fuel pump (5) in its installation position, on the fuel tank support. (5) Put the bolts (7) and washers (8) in their installation position. Tighten the bolts. (6) Do the bonding protection procedures for the fuel pump base ( AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-802-A/200). (7) Connect the fuel line tubing (6) to the electrical fuel pump (5). (8) (FOR ACFT POST-MOD SB145-28-0030) Install the nut (1), washer (2), screw (5) and clamps (3) (4), and attach the electrical harness, as applicable. Refer to (Figure 406).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (9) Lubricate with Molykote DC-33 light grease and install the new O-ring on the electrical connector (4). CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE NUTS AND FAYING SURFACES BETWEEN THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR AND THE FUEL TANK WALL ARE CLEAN TO PREVENT AN UNSATISFACTORY ELECTRICAL BONDING. (10) Prepare the connector support surface for bonding. Do the bonding procedures, method 13 (AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-801-A/200). (11) Apply the anti-corrosive spray to the electrical connector (4). The product must cover the contacts without excess spray. Install the connector in its installation position and attach it with the nut (2). Safety the nut. (12) Do the bonding protection procedures for the connector ( AMM TASK 20-13-21-910-802-A/200). (13) Connect the electrical connector (1). J. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-003-A (1) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is a part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations of the Aircraft Maintenance Program. (2) Install these access panels (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) and (AMM MPP 28-11-01/400) as applicable. (a) LH fuel tank: • 155BZ/155CZ. (b) RH fuel tank: • 156CZ/156BZ. (c) Wing stub: • 192AL/192BR. (3) Refuel the aircraft ( AMM TASK 12-11-01-600-801-A/300) as applicable. (4) Examine the access panels which were removed for fuel leakage. Correct as necessary. (5) On the circuit breaker panel, close these circuit breakers and remove the DO-NOT- CLOSE tag from them: • FUEL PUMPS - 1A, 1B, 1C (2A, 2B, 2C). CAUTION: DAMAGE TO THE FUEL PUMP WILL OCCUR IF IT OPERATES WITH NO FUEL (DRY OPERATION). THUS, SEE THE FUEL LEVEL IN THE FUEL TANKS BEFORE YOU TURN ON THE FUEL PUMP.
