Fuel-Feed-Line Leak Test - Operational Test (Figure 501)  (Figure 502)  (Figure 503)  SUBTASK 790-002-A CAUTION: DO NOT TURN ON THE FUEL PUMPS WITHOUT FUEL IN THE TANK. IF YOU DO, THE FUEL PUMPS WILL BURN. (1) Set the two pump power switches (1) to the ON position. (2) Set the APU master switch (2) to the ON position. (3) Do a check to make sure that the position indicator of the defueling shut-off valve (3) and of the cross-feed valve (4) are in the CLOSED position. (4) Do a check to make sure that the indicator position of the APU fuel-shut-off valve (5) and of the right/left engine shut-off valves (6) and (7) are in the OPEN position. (5) Do a visual check on the connections and valves for leaks in the rear wing stub (8). (6) Do a visual check on the fuel-line shroud drain (9) for leaks. (7) Do a visual check on the engine fuel-feed line hose (10) for leaks. (8) Do a visual check on the fuel pumps and metering unit (FPMU) (11) for leaks. (9) Do a visual check on the engine low-pressure switches (12) for leaks. (10) Do a visual check on the APU fuel line (13) for leaks. (11) If applicable, repair the fuel feed line as necessary to remove the leak(s). Do the check again and make sure that there is no leak. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) If there is a leak in the fuel-line-shroud drain (9), do the engine fuel-feed-line-shroud leak test (AMM TASK 28-21-10-700-801-A/500) and the APU fuel-feed-line-shroud leak test (AMM TASK 28-22-03-700-801-A/500) to find the location of the leak and repair. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them: • APU CONTROL. • START 1/2. (3) Set the two pump power switches (1) to the OFF position. (4) Set the APU master switch (2) to the OFF position.
