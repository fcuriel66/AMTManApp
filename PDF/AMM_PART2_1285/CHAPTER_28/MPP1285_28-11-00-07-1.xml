			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • Unless you are told to do differently, do not paint the holes with close tolerance (&lt; = IT7, according to ISO R 286). • Use a brush to apply the antibiological compound to the areas where the pressure spray gun cannot get, or where its use and immediate cleaning is not possible. • Wing assemblies previously treated with fuel sealant can be force dried in an oven at a work zone temperature of no less than 43ÃÂ°C (110ÃÂ°F) for no less than 3 hours. • For the minimum curing time of the antibiological compound, refer to the recommendations of the manufacturer of the antibiological compound. • If you will apply sealant after the application and cure of the antibiological compound, paint the sealant in contact with fuel with antibiological compound too. • According to ASTM D 1005, the thickness of the dry coating must be 30 ÃÂ± 10 μm. The application of the two cross coatings mentioned above is enough to ensure that (the film formed by the two cross coatings is between 25 and 43 μm). (c) Clean the suction spray gun with solvent, immediately after the application of the antibiological compound. (d) If it is necessary to do the procedure again, sand the area and the adjacent area, clean it with solvent, dry the area with a dry and clean cloth, and apply the antibiological compound. (3) NOTE: • Do the process as many times as necessary to get the specified measure. • Before the accelerate curing, let the coating to dry at ambient temperature for 2 hours (flash-off). • Temperatures below 18ÃÂ°C are not recommended for curing. • The tack-free condition occurs in 2 hours (max.) in normal conditions.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 28-11-00-300-802-A EFFECTIVITY: ALL 3. DECONTAMINATION OF INTEGRAL FUEL TANKS A. General (1) This task gives the procedures to do the decontamination of the fuel tanks. (2) This task is applicable to the LH fuel tank and to the RH fuel tank. (3) You must always do this task when you find contamination during an inspection. (4) Clean the fuel tank at the earliest opportunity after you confirm the presence of heavy contamination as defined in the ( AMM TASK 28-11-00-300-803-A/700). The longer the tank structure is exposed to microbiological contamination the greater the risk of corrosion. When you complete the cleaning process, do a detailed inspection of the fuel tanks for the presence of corrosion. If the corrosion is present, do the related repair as given in the Corrosion Prevention Manual (CPM 51-14-00) and apply Alodine (CPM 51-21-04). Apply the topcoating (AMS-C-27725) ( AMM TASK 28-11-00-300-801-A/700). (5) Two methods are recommended to remove the microbiological growth. If the contaminated area is small, wipers dampened with alcohol, a soft fibre brush or fresh water with detergent/ solvent is used to remove the growth. If the contaminated area is large (and manual removal is not practical), hot water pressure washing to remove the growth is used. If pressure water is used, remove all the in-tanks FQIS components, to prevent damage. It is recommended that you remove the fuel scavenge pumps and associated plumbing for bench cleaning. Take care and make sure that the fuel tank sealant is not damaged during the pressure washing operation. NOTE: The use of a detergent is not let with a hot water pressure washer. (6) Note that the cleaning procedure does not kill the microbiological contamination. The procedures are used to physically remove the debris left after heavy microbiological contamination, which would otherwise not be killed during a biocide treatment. After the cleaning operation, treat the fuel tanks with a biocide to kill any remaining micro-organisms. (7) The fuel tank structure can contain flow holes and drain tubes through the wing stringers. These drain passages let fuel and water to drain to the sump drains found at the lowest area of fuel tank. Keep the holes and tubes clear of unwanted material. If the flow-holes or drain tubes become blocked, the proper drainage of fuel and water will not occur. (8) After the decontamination, it is recommended that you keep the microorganism monitoring procedure ( AMM TASK 28-11-00-300-803-A/700). B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (5) Prior to refueling the aircraft it is necessary to calculate the concentration at which biocide must be mixed with fuel such that the final concentration of biocide is within the fuel tank to be treated. Table 701 - Biocide Concentration Biocide Concentration Biobor JF 270 ppm by weight Kathon FP 1.5 100 ppm by volume Table 702 - Formula Biobor JF Kathon FP 1.5 C(uf) = 270 (FOB + UPLIFT) / UPLIFT C(uf) = 100 (FOB + UPLIFT) / UPLIFT C (uf) = Concentration for the fuel to be uplift FOB = Fuel quantity already on board when uplift fuel is being added UPLIFT = Fuel quantity with biocide to be added NOTE: • You must consult the manufacturer's data sheet to calculate the correct concentration of biocide. • The concentration of Kathon in the refuel quantity must not be more than 400 ppm by volume. If the result of the calculation is more than 400 ppm, you must defuel the aircraft and refuel the aircraft with the correct concentration of fuel and Kathon (100 ppm by volume). • The concentration of Biobor JF in the refuel quantity must not be more than 1000 ppm by weight. If the result of the calculation is more than 1000 ppm, you must defuel the aircraft and refuel the aircraft with the correct concentration of fuel and Biobor JF (270 ppm by weight). (6) For metered injection method, go to SUBTASK 613-004-A. (7) For overwing fuel port method, go to SUBTASK 613-005-A J. Biocide Treatment of Fuel Tanks - Metered Injection Cart SUBTASK 613-004-A WARNING: NEVER ADD BIOCIDE TO AN EMPTY TANK. CAUTION: • JET ENGINE FUEL, BY ITS NATURE, ALWAYS CONTAINS SOME WATER. MAKE SURE THAT FUEL HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND FILTERED, TO REMOVE WATER AND DEBRIS. IN THE PRESENCE OF EXCESS WATER, EITHER THROUGH DIRECT DILUTION OF BIOCIDE WITH WATER OR BY ADDING BIOCIDE TO "WET" FUEL, I.E., FUEL FROM A SUMP AREA, FORMATION OF SOLIDS MAY OCCUR. • BEFORE YOU USE IT, MAKE SURE THAT THE SHELF LIFE OF THE BIOCIDE PRODUCT TO BE USED IS NOT EXPIRED AND THAT IT IS CORRECTLY STORED AS SPECIFIED ON THE PRODUCT PACKAGE. (1) Drain water from the fuel tank ( AMM MPP 12-11-03/300). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-804-A/700 28-11-00 Page 29 of 33 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL NOTE: It is important to drain the water from the fuel tanks. If there is water in the tanks, the formation of solids will occur when you add biocide. (2) Check on the repeater the fuel quantity in the tank (AMM SDS 28-23-00/1). (3) Refuel ( AMM TASK 12-11-01-600-801-A/300) or defuel the tanks ( AMM TASK 12-11-01-600-802-A/300) or ( AMM TASK 12-11-02-600-802-A/300), as applicable, so as the remaining fuel is at least 1/3 of the total capacity. NOTE: If the remaining fuel is less than 1/3 of the total capacity , add untreated fuel until the total fuel is 1/3 of the total capacity. (4) There are two types metered-injection carts: • Adjustable metered injection cart • Non-adjustable metered injection cart (5) Refer to the biocide data sheet and metered-injection cart manual to adjust the applicable proportion of biocide product to be added in the aircraft fuel tanks. NOTE: • Make sure that the aircraft integral tanks are 1/3 full before their replenishment starts. This will ensure a faster and more complete dispersion of the biocide. (6) Use the adjustable metered injection cart as follows: (a) This type of metered injection cart is equipped with an adjustable concentration setting. You can adjust the concentration setting and use this method to add biocide to the fuel tanks during the refuelling operation. Refer to the Biocide Metering Injection Equipment manufacturer’s manual to its correct installation. (b) Complete the tank with the blended fuel using the metering injection equipment in accordance with the equipment manual. Refer to ( AMM TASK 12-11-01-600-801-A/300). (7) Use the non-Adjustable Metered Injection as follows: (a) This type of metered injection cart is not field adjustable, the cart must be calibrated. Refer to the metered injection cart manual to recalibrate the cart. (b) Recalibration of the cart is necessary to account for the typical remaining fuel in aircraft fuel tanks. To achieve the desired 270ppm concentration for Biobor JF or 100ppm concentration for Kathon FP 1.5 and account for the remaining fuel, the factory adjustment for the cart must be changed. (c) Complete the tank with the blended fuel using the metering injection equipment in accordance with the equipment manual. Refer to ( AMM TASK 12-11-01-600-801-A/300). (8) Allow biocide loaded fuel to soak in tanks for a minimum of: • Biobor JF: 36 - 72 hours • Kathon FP 1.5: 12 - 24 hours EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-804-A/700 28-11-00 Page 30 of 33 Rev 53 - Oct 31/17 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
