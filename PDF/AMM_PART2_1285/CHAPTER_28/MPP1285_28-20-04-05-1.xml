(1) Do an operational test of the PUMP SEL and PUMP PWR switches of tank 1 as follows: (a) Set the PUMP PWR switch of TANK 1 to ON position. Result: 1 On the MFD fuel page, the "A" indication for the tank 1 pump comes into view. (b) Set the PUMP SEL switch to the 1B position. Result: 1 On the MFD fuel page, the "B" indication for the tank 1 pump comes into view. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 28-20-04 Page 3 of 6 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
