Preparation SUBTASK 841-007-A WARNING: • BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 28-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. • FUEL LINE CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE. A GOOD FLOW OF AIR MUST BE AVAILABLE WHEN THE WORK IS DONE IN A CLOSED AREA. CAUTION: • DO NOT LET THE CLEANING PRODUCT TOUCH PAINT-FINISHED SURFACES NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THEM. • USE CLEAN, SOFT (COTTON), NON-SYNTHETIC AND LINT-FREE CLOTHS ONLY. DO NOT PUT REMAINING CLEANING MATERIAL BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINERS TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION. • DO NOT POUR CLEANING PRODUCT DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE TO BE CLEANED. • DO NOT LET THE CLEANING PRODUCT EVAPORATE BEFORE IT IS DRIED WITH THE CLOTH.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (1) Remove these access panels to get access to the APU/engine fuel-feed-line shroud as applicable: (a) Wing stub: • 155FZ/156FZ/155GZ/156GZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (b) Passenger cabin: • 251FF/251HF/252DF/261DF/262BF/262CF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (c) Baggage compartment: • 271AF/271BF/271CF/271FF/272AF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (d) Baggage compartment internal panels: • 271ALW/272ARW ( AMM MPP 06-41-05/100). (2) Remove as much old sealant as possible from the surface to be sealed of the engine fuel-feed-line shroud or/and of the APU fuel-feed-line shroud. (3) Soak a cloth with solvent, remove the unwanted quantity of product, and apply the cloth to the area to be cleaned/sealed of the engine fuel-feed-line shroud or/and of the APU fuel-feed-line shroud. (4) Dry the area with other clean and dry cloth before the solvent evaporates. (5) Do steps 3 and 4 again. Replace the cloths when they become dirty. Stop only when no signs of discoloration stay on the dry cloth. (6) Put a protection against contamination (dust and grease) in the cleaned area until the sealant is applied. (7) On the circuit breaker panel, open these circuit breakers and attach a DO-NOT- CLOSE tag to them: • FUEL PUMPS 1A/1B/1C. • FUEL PUMPS 2A/2B/2C. • START 1/2. J. Fuel Line Shroud Sealing - Maintenance Practices (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 390-007-A WARNING: BEFORE YOU USE IT, MAKE SURE THAT THE PERMITTED LIFE OF THE SEALANT COMPOUND TO BE USED IS NOT EXPIRED AND THAT IT IS CORRECTLY STORED. (1) Add catalyst to the base compound in the proportion recommended by the manufacturer. Fully mix them until the color is the same in all the mixture and there are no air bubbles in it. (2) (If applicable to the aircraft configuration) With the half-cover shrouds (1) on the Permaswage connection (2), tighten the lock wires (5) at the ends of the half cover shrouds (wind twice). Bend the end of the lock wire on the lock wire. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-802-A/200 CONFIG-2 28-21-10 Page 4 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) (If applicable to the aircraft configuration) With the half-cover shrouds (1) on the Permaswage connection (2), install the clamps (5) at the ends of the half cover shrouds (wind twice). (4) Do the fillet sealing: NOTE: • Apply the sealant immediately after the mixture is completed. • Do not apply the sealant on surfaces at temperatures lower than 16ÃÂ°C (60.8ÃÂ°F). Keep the surface temperature between 16ÃÂ°C (60.8ÃÂ°F) and 26ÃÂ°C (78.8ÃÂ°F)0 to make sure that the sealant bonds satisfactorily and there are no runouts during the cure. • Discard the sealant which becomes very thick or is difficult to be applied. • Hot and filtered (to prevent contamination) air or applicable lamps can be used for the acceleration of the sealant curing time. But do not let the surface temperature be more than 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). • The application life is 1/2 h, at a temperature of 25ÃÂ°C (75.8ÃÂ°F) and air relative humidity of 50%. • The curing time is approximately 30 h at a temperature of 25ÃÂ°C (75.8ÃÂ°F) and approximately 5 h at a temperature of 50ÃÂ°C (119ÃÂ°F), with a resistance-heated air circulation. • The sealing bead must have no air bubbles. The thickest part of the bead must be aligned with the edge of the adjacent line of the overlapped structural elements. (5) Apply sealant along the joint of the APU/engine fuel-feed-line shroud with an extrusion gun or a spatula to make it fill the empty spaces and in the shape of a continuous bead which touches the adjacent beads. (6) (If applicable to the aircraft configuration) Apply sealant on the lock wire. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-007-A (1) Complete the APU/engine fuel-feed-line shroud installation as applicable (AMM TASK 28-21-10-400-802-A/400). (2) Close access panels as applicable, after the sealing procedure. (a) Wing stub: • 155FZ/156FZ/155GZ/156GZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (b) Passenger cabin: • 251FF/251HF/252DF/261DF/262BF/262CF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (c) Baggage compartment: • 271AF/271BF/271CF/271FF/272AF (AMM MPP 06-41-02/100). (d) Baggage compartment internal panels: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 300-802-A/200 CONFIG-2 28-21-10 Page 5 of 8 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
