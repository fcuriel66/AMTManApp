			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL H. Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task Wing-to-fuselage fairing I. Preparation SUBTASK 841-003-A WARNING: FUEL LINE CLEANING PRODUCTS ARE TOXIC AND FLAMMABLE. A GOOD FLOW OF AIR MUST BE AVAILABLE WHEN THE WORK IS DONE IN A CLOSED AREA. CAUTION: • DO NOT PERMIT THE CLEANING PRODUCT TO TOUCH PAINT-FINISH SURFACES, NOT TO CAUSE DAMAGE TO THEM. • USE CLEAN, SOFT (COTTON), NON-SYNTHETIC AND LINT-FREE CLOTHS ONLY. DO NOT PUT REMAINING CLEANING MATERIAL BACK INTO ORIGINAL CONTAINERS TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION. • DO NOT POUR CLEANING PRODUCT DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE TO BE CLEANED. • DO NOT PERMIT CLEANING PRODUCT TO EVAPORATE BEFORE IT IS DRIED WITH THE CLOTH. (1) Remove as much old sealant as possible from the surface to be sealed of the coupling- cover connection (13). (2) Soak a cloth with solvent, remove the unwanted quantity of product, and apply the cloth to the area to be cleaned/sealed of the coupling-cover connection (13). (3) Dry the area with other clean and dry cloth before the solvent evaporates. (4) Do steps 3 and 4 again. Replace the cloths when they become dirty. Stop only when no signs of discoloration stay in the dry cloth. (5) Put a protection against contamination (dust and grease) in the cleaned area until the sealant is applied. (6) Make sure that, on the circuit breaker panel, the circuit breakers below are open and tagged: • DEFUELING. • REFUELING 1/2/3. J. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A WARNING: BEFORE YOU DO THE TASK, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN AMM MPP 28-00-00/200 TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. (1) Install the pressure fueling/defueling adapter (20). EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 28-23-01 Page 7 of 9 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Install the bolts (17), washers (18), and spring washers (19). (3) Lightly apply Molykote lubricant to the new O-rings (16), to the exposed surface of the flanges, and to the internal face of the sleeve (15), and install them. (4) Install the Gamah clamp (14). (5) Install the coupling-cover connection (13). WARNING: BEFORE YOU USE IT, MAKE SURE THAT THE PERMITTED LIFE OF THE SEALANT COMPOUND TO BE USED IS NOT EXPIRED AND THAT IS CORRECTLY STORED. (6) Add catalyst to the base compound in the proportion recommended by the manufacturer. Fully mix them until the color is the same in all the points of the mixture and there are no air bubbles in it. (7) Fillet sealing: NOTE: • Apply the sealant immediately after the mixture is completed. • Do not apply the sealant on surfaces at temperatures lower than 16ÃÂ°C (60.8ÃÂ°F). Keep the surface temperature between 16ÃÂ°C (60.8ÃÂ°F) and 26ÃÂ°C (78.8ÃÂ°F), to make sure that the sealant bonds satisfactorily and there are no runouts during the cure. • Discard the sealant which becomes very thick or is difficult to be applied. • Hot and filtered (to prevent contamination) air or applicable lamps can be used for the acceleration of the sealant cure time. But do not let the surface temperature be more than 55ÃÂ°C (131ÃÂ°F). • The application life is 2 h, at a temperature of 25ÃÂ°C (75.8ÃÂ°F) and air relative humidity of 50%. • The curing time is approximately 30 h at a temperature of 25ÃÂ°C (75.8ÃÂ°F) and approximately 5 h at a temperature of 50ÃÂ°C (119ÃÂ°F), with a resistance-heated air circulation. • The sealing fillet must have no air bubbles. The thickest part of the fillet must be aligned with the edge of the adjacent line of the overlapped structural elements. (8) Apply sealant on the joint of the coupling-cover connection (13) with an extrusion gun or a spatula, to make it fill the empty spaces and in the shape of a continuous fillet which touches the adjacent fillets. (9) Install the clamp (12) and safety it. (10) Lightly apply Molykote lubricant to the new O-ring (11). (11) Install the O-ring (11), nut (10), and elbow (9) to the pressure fueling/defueling adapter (20). (12) Close the protection cover (8).
