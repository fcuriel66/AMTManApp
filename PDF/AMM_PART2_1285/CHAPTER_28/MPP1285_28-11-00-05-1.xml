			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 28-11-00-700-801-A EFFECTIVITY: ACFT WITH WET WINGSTUB 2. FUELED-TANK LEAK CHECK - OPERATIONAL CHECK A. General (1) The function of this test is to identify the wing integral-fuel-tank leaks that are a flight safety hazard (and thus, must be repaired immediately) and leaks that can only be monitored until the subsequent scheduled maintenance is done. The leak location and the size of the wet area, in a given period of time, will permit you to make the separation between the two types of leaks. This test is done with the fuel tank full. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (7) Put the ladder in the work area. (8) Remove the access panels shown below: (a) Center lower fairing: • 192AL/192BR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (b) LH/RH Underwing area: • 551AB/651AB ( AMM MPP 06-44-00/100). (9) Refer to the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD - 145/1137) to do the inspection of the internal structural elements. NOTE: This leak test procedure is only applicable when you are fully sure that the leak was caused by defects in the interface sealings or by loss of tightness in the fastener sealing. J. Fueled-Tank Leak Check - Operational Check (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 790-002-A WARNING: • THE FUEL VAPORS ARE TOXIC AND CAN CAUSE IRRITATION TO THE SKIN AND EYES. • WEAR MASK AND GLOVES NOT TO BREATHE FUEL VAPORS. • DO NOT PERMIT THE AIR/FUEL MIXTURE TO COME TO AN EXPLOSIVE LEVEL. DO THE TEST IN AREAS WITH A GOOD FLOW OF AIR. CAUTION: • LEAKS CAUSED BY A STRUCTURAL FAILURE MUST BE REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY AND BEFORE THE SUBSEQUENT FLIGHT. • DO NOT PUT THE REMAINING CLEANING MATERIAL BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINERS TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION. • DO NOT POUR THE CLEANING PRODUCT DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE TO BE CLEANED. • DO NOT PERMIT THE CLEANING PRODUCT TO EVAPORATE BEFORE IT IS DRIED WITH THE CLOTH. (1) To find the leak area: (a) Do a good external visual inspection to make sure that there are no structural failures (for example, cracks and loose, broken, or lost fastener). (b) With cloths soaked in solvent, clean the area where you think there is a leak. Dry the area with clean cloths. (c) Apply regular powder to make it easier to find the point of external leakage and make an estimate of the leak extension. NOTE: If, after the regular powder is applied, the accurate leak location is on the perimeter of the area cleaned, clean the area and apply the regular powder again for a better estimate of the leak.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Leak estimate: (a) Identify the leak location as follows: 1 Type I area - Exposed areas: a Areas with a good flow of air where leakage cannot go to a potential fire source. Upper and lower wing skin, but not the areas defined in type II. 2 Type II area - Areas subject to direct lightning strike: a Areas with a good flow of air where leakage cannot go to a possible fire source, and which are subject to a direct lightning strike ( AMM TASK 05-50-01-200-801-A/600). 3 Type III area - Semi-enclosed areas: a Areas of spar II not fully open to a good flow of air where the leakage cannot go to a possible fire source. b Internal areas of the wing-to-fuselage fairings. 4 Type IV area - Closed areas: a Internal area of the wing tip fairing. b Wing stub (dry area). c Internal area of the wing leading edge. d Internal area of the aileron PCA. NOTE: The estimate of fuel leak in the tank is necessary to identify leaks that are a flight safety hazard and, thus, must be repaired immediately and leaks that can only be monitored until the subsequent scheduled maintenance is done. The size of the wet area and the leak location will permit you to make this estimate. (b) After the regular powder is applied, identify type of the leaks by the size of the wet area, as follows (Figure 501): 1 Stain: a The area made moist by the leakage is not more than 40 mm (1 1/2 inch) at its largest dimension, 30 minutes after it was fully cleaned and the regular powder was applied. The fuel does not fall or flow off the surface. 2 Seepage: a The area made moist by the leakage is not more than 100 mm (4 inch) at its largest dimension, 30 minutes after it was fully cleaned and the regular powder was applied. The fuel does not fall or flow off the surface. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 700-801-A/500 28-11-00 Page 5 of 51 Rev 48 - Oct 30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

No immediate repair action is necessary; frequent inspections must be done to make sure that the leak does not became larger. Daily checks are recommended. 2. No immediate repair action is necessary; frequent inspections must be done to make sure that the leak does not become larger. Daily checks are recommended. Repair action must be done in the subsequent A check to remove the problem. 3. Do not make the repairs until you are back to your main facility, if there is no indication of structural damage and the leak is not in a critical area (vapor formation area, ignition source area, and area subject to direct lightning strikes). 4. Immediate action is necessary. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Clean the area where the powder was applied. (2) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them: • APU CONTROL.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL CAUTION: • LEAKS CAUSED BY A STRUCTURAL FAILURE MUST BE REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY AND BEFORE THE SUBSEQUENT FLIGHT. • DO NOT PUT THE REMAINING CLEANING MATERIAL BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINERS TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION. • DO NOT POUR THE CLEANING PRODUCT DIRECTLY ON THE SURFACE TO BE CLEANED. • DO NOT PERMIT THE CLEANING PRODUCT TO EVAPORATE BEFORE IT IS DRIED WITH THE CLOTH. (1) To find the leak area: (a) Do a good external visual inspection to make sure that there are no structural failures (for example, cracks and loose, broken, or lost fastener). (b) With cloths soaked in solvent, clean the area where you think there is a leak. Dry the area with clean cloths. (c) Apply leak detection powder to make it easier to find the point of exterior leakage and make an estimate of the leak extension. NOTE: If, after the leak detection powder is applied, the accurate leak location is on the perimeter of the area cleaned, clean the area and apply the regular powder again for a better estimate of the leak. (2) Leak estimate: (a) Identify the leak location as follows: 1 Type I area - Exposed areas: a Areas with a good flow of air where leakage cannot go to a potential fire source. Upper and lower wing skin, but not the areas defined in type II. 2 Type II area - Areas subject to direct lightning strike: a Areas with a good flow of air where leakage cannot go to a possible fire source, and which are subject to a direct lightning strike ( AMM TASK 05-50-01-200-801-A/600). 3 Type III area - Semi-enclosed areas: a Areas of spar II not fully open to a good flow of air where the leakage cannot go to a possible fire source. b Internal area of the wing-to-fuselage fairings. 4 Type IV area - Closed areas: a Internal area of the wing tip fairing. b Wing stub undersurface. c Internal area of the wing leading edge.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL d Internal area of the aileron PCA. NOTE: The estimate of fuel leak in the tank is necessary to identify leaks that are a flight safety hazard and, thus, must be repaired immediately and leaks that can only be monitored until the subsequent scheduled maintenance is done. The size of the wet area and the leak location will permit you to make this estimate. (b) After the regular powder is applied, identify the type of the leaks by the size of the wet area, as follows (Figure 501): 1 Stain: a The area made moist by the leakage is not more than 40 mm (1 1/2 inch) at its largest dimension 30 minutes after it was fully cleaned and the regular powder was applied. The fuel does not fall or flow off the surface. 2 Seepage: a The area made moist by the leakage is not more than 100 mm (4 inch) at its largest dimension 30 minutes after it was fully cleaned and the regular powder was applied. The fuel does not fall or flow off the surface. 3 Heavy seepage: a The area made moist by the leakage is not more than 150 mm (6 inch) at its largest dimension 30 minutes after it was fully cleaned and the regular powder was applied. The fuel does not fall or flow off the surface. 4 Running leak: a A leak larger than those specified above, in which the fuel comes into view again immediately after the cleaning. The fuel falls or flows off the surface. (3) After the two classification types (by location and by size of wet area) are defined, use table 1 to identify the repair action.
