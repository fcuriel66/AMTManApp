			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (3) Energize the aircraft with an external DC - Power Supply ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). J. Operational Check of the Defueling Shut-off Valve (Figure 501)  SUBTASK 710-002-A (1) Do the check below: (a) On the refueling/defueling control panel, open the defueling switch guard and set the switch to the OPEN position. Result: 1 On the refueling/defueling control panel, make sure that the defueling light comes on. 2 Make sure that the position indicator, at the defueling shut-off valve, shows the OPEN position. (b) On the refueling/defueling control panel, set the defueling switch to the CLOSED position. Result: 1 On the refueling/defueling control panel, make sure that the defueling light goes off. 2 Make sure that the position indicator, at the defueling shut-off valve, shows the CLOSED position. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Close the defueling switch guard. (2) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200). (3) Do an inspection on the fuel quantity indication harness (AMM TASK 28-41-00-200-801-A/600). NOTE: The inspection of fuel quantity indication harness is a part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations of the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRB). (4) Install access panel 155EZ/156EZ (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (5) Close the access panel 191BR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100).
