NOTE: The inspection of fuel-quantity indication harness is a part of Critical Design Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCL) in the Airworthiness Limitations of the Aircraft Maintenance Program. (2) Install the access panels removed in step 3.I. Refer to AMM MPP 06-41-01/100 (3) On the circuit breaker panel, close the circuit breakers below and remove the DO- NOT-CLOSE tag from them: • FUEL PUMPS - 1A, 1B, 1C (2A, 2B, 2C). CAUTION: DAMAGE TO THE FUEL PUMP WILL OCCUR IF IT OPERATES WITH NO FUEL (DRY OPERATION). THUS, CHECK THE FUEL LEVEL IN THE FUEL TANKS BEFORE YOU TURN ON THE FUEL PUMP. (4) Do an operational check of the low pressure warning system. Refer to AMM TASK 28-45-00-700-801-A/500.
