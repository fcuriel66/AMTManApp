			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • WARNING: WHEN YOU OPEN THE FUEL TANK, THE FUEL-AIR MIXTURE CAN BE TOO RICH TO BE EASILY IGNITED. BUT, DURING THE VENTILATION OF THE TANKS, THE FUEL-AIR MIXTURE CAN FALL TO AN EXPLOSIVE LEVEL. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FUEL-AIR MIXTURE CAN BE KEPT IN AN AREA NOT VENTILATED OF THE TANK IN EXPLOSIVE CONCENTRATIONS. • ALL JET FUEL CAUSES INJURY TO THE SKIN. DO NOT LET THESE FLUIDS TOUCH YOU. • MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNICIAN IS TRAINED AND PREPARED TO DO THE FUEL SYSTEM MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES. • IF YOU MUST DO TASKS WITH A HEATING GUN, OBEY THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN WM 20-10-00. EXPLOSION CAN OCCUR IF YOU USE AN NOT QUALIFIED HEATING GUN NEAR HAZARDOUS LOCATIONS [1] . • DO THE FUEL SYSTEM MAINTENANCE ONLY IN AN AREA WHICH PERMITS THE FREE MOVEMENT AND ACCESS OF FIRE FIGHTING EQUIPMENT AND PERSONS. MAKE SURE THAT FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ARE AVAILABLE AND READY TO BE USED IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. • ELECTRICALLY GROUND THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE CORRECT CABLES ( AMM MPP 20-40-02/200). • STATICALLY GROUND ALL ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT ( AMM MPP 20-40-02/200). THIS PREVENTS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF STATIC ELECTRICITY WHEN THE EQUIPMENT IS USED. • STOP FUEL-TANK MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES AND CLOSE THE ACCESS TO THE FUEL TANKS WHEN THUNDERSTORMS OR LIGHTNING [1] ARE IN LESS THAN 16 KM (10 MILES) . • MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO PERSONS WITH LIT CIGARETTES OR OTHER SOURCES OF SPARKS OR OPEN FLAMES IN A RADIUS OF 15 M (50 FT) FROM THE AREA WHERE THE MAINTENANCE IS DONE. • DO NOT PRESSURIZE THE AIRCRAFT WITH THE FUSELAGE FUEL SYSTEM DISASSEMBLED, EVEN IF PARTIALLY, OR DAMAGE TO THE AFT FUEL TANKS WILL OCCUR. CAUTION: AFTER THE REMOVAL OF COMPONENTS, DO NOT LET THE FITTINGS OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS STAY NOT PROTECTED. INSTALL CAPS OR PLUGS ON ALL OF THEM. DO NOT USE ADHESIVE TAPE FOR THIS, BECAUSE ITS SUBSEQUENT REMOVAL CAN CAUSE STATIC ELECTRICITY. (1) During the fuel system maintenance tasks, obey the precautions above to prevent injury to persons and damage to material.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL • DO NOT USE LOCKWIRE INSIDE THE FUEL TANKS. THE ENDS OF THE LOCKWIRES CAN BE POINTS OF ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE. [1] Not applicable to clean, dry (no fuel) tanks and under fire-safe condition. Refer to Preparation for an Internal Fuel Tank Maintenance Procedure. (2) Obey the safety precautions listed above when you do maintenance procedures inside the fuel tanks. E. Preparation for an Internal Fuel Tank Maintenance Procedure WARNING: READ THE FUEL SYSTEM SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT INJURY TO PERSONS AND DAMAGE TO MATERIAL. (1) When you do maintenance tasks for which it is necessary to open the fuel tanks, obey these instructions: (a) Defuel ( AMM MPP 12-11-02/300) and drain ( AMM MPP 12-11-03/300) the tank in which you will do the task. (b) Deenergize the aircraft (TASK 20-40-01-862-801-A). Attach a DO-NOT-SET-TO-ON tag to the GPU pushbutton. (c) Make sure that the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches, on the electrical panel, on the overhead panel, are set at OFF. Attach a DO-NOT-SET-TO-AUTO tag to the BATT 1 and BATT 2 switches. (d) Remove panels as necessary to get access to the internal side of the fuel tank ( AMM MPP 06-44-00/100 and AMM MPP 28-11-01/400). To remove the remaining fuel, you can absorb it with the aid of, for example, a sponge. (e) Ventilate the fuel tank with a ventilation equipment: 1 Put the ventilation equipment in the correct area. 2 Statically ground the aircraft and the ventilation equipment ( AMM MPP 20-40-02/200). 3 (c) Turn on the ventilation equipment. WARNING: DO NOT START OR STOP THE VENTILATION EQUIPMENT AFTER ITS HOSE IS ATTACHED TO THE FUEL TANK. THERE CAN CAUSE A SPARK. 4 Attach and ground the ventilation equipment hose to the fuel tank access. (f) Do a check for vapor fuel concentration in the fuel tank. Obey the combustible gas indicator manufacturer’s instructions. When the indication is in the permitted limits, then the tank is in a fire-safe condition. WARNING: IF THE OXYGEN LEVELS ARE OUT OF THE RANGE FROM 19.5% TO 23.5% BY VOLUME, WEAR AN AIR PURIFYING RESPIRATOR WITH AN AIR SUPPLY FROM OUT OF THE TANK. (g) During the task, the fuel tank must be continuously ventilated. Monitor the combustible gas indicator values every half hour or less.
