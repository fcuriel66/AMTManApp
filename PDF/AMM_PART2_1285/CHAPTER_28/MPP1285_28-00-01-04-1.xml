			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL FUEL PLUMBING - REMOVAL/INSTALLATION EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 1. General A. Always obey these procedures during the removal/installation of tubes: (1) System identification. (2) Tubing assembly configuration. (3) Tubing material identification. B. Serviceable nuts and fitting can be used again after the removal of tubing. C. For the tubing installation, correctly align the fittings and tubing to permit the nuts to be turned down by hand before the wrench tightening. Do not use fitting nuts to pull tubing and/or fittings into alignment. D. Use the applicable torque wrench for the correct torque application. If it is necessary to use extensions, the torque wrench must be adjusted to make an allowance for the torque value increase or decrease. Refer to the torque connection method in (AMM MPP 20-10-01/200). E. Torque values, when given in the Maintenance Manual tasks, have priority over the torque given in this section. F. The procedures in this section are given in the sequence below. The tasks identified with ( ♦) are part of the Scheduled Maintenance Requirements Document (SMRD).

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) If applicable, remove the clamps, tube clamp blocks, bonding wires that support the tube to be removed, and, if necessary, the adjacent tube. (3) Put a container below the tubing (fluid systems only). (4) Remove the tube or hose as applicable. CAUTION: • DO NOT ALLOW LINES OR FITTINGS TO BE WITHOUT CAPS: DIRT CAN CAUSE SYSTEM CONTAMINATION, DAMAGE TO COMPONENTS, AND LEAKAGE. • CLEAN ALL ACCUMULATION OF FUEL FALLEN DOWN. (5) Install protection caps at the ends of removed tubes and system fittings. EMB-145  - AMM 1285 000-801-A/400 28-00-01 Page 3 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.

Persons Recommended QTY FUNCTION PLACE 1 Does the task In the repair area H. Installation (Figure 401)  SUBTASK 420-002-A (1) Make sure that the tubing is correctly identified with the part number and color bands. NOTE: The tubing used inside of the fuel tanks must not have external markings such as decals and color bands. (2) Do a check of the tubing for abrasion, kinking, protection, wear, dents, scores, and notches. (3) Inspect the flared ends of the tubing for cracks, burrs, sharp edges, or other unsatisfactory conditions. Make sure that the sleeves are correctly installed on the flared ends.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (4) Make sure that the nuts move freely on the sleeves. (5) Remove all protection caps tubes or hoses. Make sure that they are not obstructed. (6) Put the tubing in the aircraft. Do not apply the final torque to clamps, tubing clamp blocks, and bonding wires, if applicable, to pull the tubing into alignment with the fitting. NOTE: If the tubing is flexible, carefully prevent kinks as a result of sharp bends or twisting. (7) Align the tubes and fittings. Let the tube end stay against the fitting. CAUTION: TOO MUCH TIGHTENING CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THREADS OR MATING PARTS. BEFORE YOU APPLY THE TORQUE, HOLD THE UNION OR FITTING WITH THE CORRECT WRENCH. (8) Hold the tube end against and aligned with the fitting. Turn the nut by hand until it touches the sleeve or flange. CAUTION: • DO NOT USE A TIGHTENING NUT TO PULL THE TUBING INTO ALIGNMENT. • DO NOT USE A FLEXIBLE-TUBING-END ADAPTER FOR TORQUE APPLICATION. • MAKE SURE THAT THE FLEXIBLE TUBE IS NOT TWISTED BEFORE AND AFTER TORQUE APPLICATION. • FOR FLEXIBLE HOSES WITH REUSABLE FITTINGS OF THE TYPE SHOWN IN FIGURE 401, APPLY TORQUE TO THE POINTS SHOWN. (9) Hold the union or fitting with the correct wrench and tighten the assembly. Refer to Table 401 and torque the tightening nut or fitting. (10) If applicable, tighten all tubing clamps, tubing clamp blocks, and bonding wires. (11) Prepare the surface to install the bonding jumpers as follows, if applicable: (a) Clean the areas to be bonded with a clean cloth soaked with Rodhiasolve E-23 solvent. (b) Rub the areas with a clean dry cloth before the solvent evaporation. (12) Install the bonding jumpers on the tubing immediately after the faying surface is cleaned, if applicable. I. Follow on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Remove all tools, materials, and equipment from the work area. (2) Make sure the area is clean. (3) On the Circuit Breaker Panel, remove the DO-NOT-CLOSE tag from them and close the circuit breakers below: EMB-145  - AMM 1285 400-801-A/400 28-00-01 Page 6 of 7 Rev 48 - Oct  30/15 Copyright ÃÂ© by Embraer S.A.
