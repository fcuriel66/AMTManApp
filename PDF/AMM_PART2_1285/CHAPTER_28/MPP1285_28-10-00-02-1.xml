			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL TASK 28-10-00-910-801-A EFFECTIVITY:  ALL 2. WING-TO-WING FUEL TRANSFER A. General (1) This procedure permits you to do a wing-to-wing fuel transfer with the electrical pumps of the fuel feed system. (2) This procedure is used only on the ground, during aircraft maintenance operations. (3) For maintenance purpose, it is possible to have one wing tank empty and the other wing tank full. B.

			<data>AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL (2) Open access door 191BR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100) to get access to the refueling/ defueling panel. (3) Lift the guard and set the defueling switch to the OPEN position. Make sure that the DEFUELING light comes on. (4) Set the MFD 1 (or 2) to the FUEL page (AMM SDS 34-22-00/1). J. Wing-to-Wing Fuel Transfer (Figure 201)  SUBTASK 910-002-A CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE NACA AIR INTAKE IS NOT BLOCKED AND THAT THE NACA AIR INTAKE IS FREE FROM BLOCKAGE.IF YOU NOT OBEY THESE CAUTIONS, DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT CAN OCCUR. (1) Transfer the fuel from the LH tank to the RH tank as follows: NOTE: • Use the MFD to monitor the fuel quantity which is transferred. • For maintenance purpose, it is possible to have one wing tank empty and the other wing tank full. (a) On the fuel control panel, set the fuel-pump selector switch to the fuel pump to be used. On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers related to the other two fuel pump which will not be used. (b) On the circuit breaker panel, open the REFUELING 2 circuit breaker. (c) On the fuel panel, set the XFEED switch to the LOW 2 position. NOTE: During the wing-to-wing fuel transfer procedure, the FUEL EQ XFEED OPN message can be displayed on the EICAS. CAUTION: • DAMAGE TO THE FUEL PUMP WILL OCCUR IF IT OPERATES WITH NO FUEL (DRY OPERATION). THUS, TURN THE PUMP OFF BEFORE THE TANK IS EMPTY. • THE FUEL QUANTITY ON THE SIDE THAT RECEIVES FUEL MUST BE MONITORED TO PREVENT TOO MUCH FILLING. OBEY THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED CAPACITY OF THE TANK (1980 KG OR 4365 LB). (d) On the fuel panel, set the PUMP PWR TANK 1 switch to the ON position. Monitor the decrease of the quantity in the LH tank and, when you have the necessary fuel quantity transferred, move the PUMP PWR TANK 1 switch back to OFF. (e) Set the XFEED switch to OFF. (f) On the circuit breaker panel, close the REFUELING 2 circuit breaker. (g) After a transfer operation, close the circuit breakers opened in 2.J.1 (a). CAUTION: MAKE SURE THAT THE NACA AIR INTAKE IS NOT BLOCKED AND THAT THE NACA AIR INTAKE IS FREE FROM BLOCKAGE.IF YOU NOT OBEY THESE CAUTIONS, DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT CAN OCCUR.

(a) On the fuel control panel, set the fuel-pump selector switch to the fuel pump to be used. On the circuit breaker panel, open the circuit breakers related to the other two fuel pumps which will not be used. (b) On the circuit breaker panel, open the “REFUELING 1” circuit breaker. (c) On the fuel panel, set the XFEED switch to the LOW 1 position. NOTE: During the wing-to-wing fuel transfer procedure, the FUEL EQ XFEED OPN message can be displayed on the EICAS. CAUTION: • DAMAGE TO THE FUEL PUMP WILL OCCUR IF IT OPERATES WITH NO FUEL (DRY OPERATION).

(f) On the circuit breaker panel, close the REFUELING 1 circuit breaker. (g) After you do a transfer operation, move the circuit breakers back to the usual position. K. Follow-on SUBTASK 842-002-A (1) Move the defueling switch back to the closed position and lower the switch guard. Make sure that the DEFUELING light goes off. (2) Close access door 191BR (AMM MPP 06-41-01/100). (3) Deenergize the aircraft ( AMM TASK 20-40-01-860-801-A/200).
